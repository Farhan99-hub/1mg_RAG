The exact cause of why blood cancer occurs is not yet identified. It is thought to occur when the blood cells undergo genetic mutations and behave abnormally. It starts when the DNA of a single cell in the bone marrow gets changed (mutation) and as a result, canΓÇÖt develop, multiply, and function normally. This rapid, out-of-control growth of abnormal cells takes place in the bone marrow and lymph nodes of the body. These abnormal cells then spill into the bloodstream. Also, abnormal and excessive production of the white blood cells or leukocytes causes overcrowding and clumping in the blood vessels. These abnormal cells also reduce the count of other normal blood cells, such as red blood cells and platelets. The white blood cells are responsible for fighting off infections and keeping the bodyΓÇÖs immune system healthy.

Examples of targeted therapy include: Monoclonal antibodies such as Inotuzumab, Gemtuzumab, Rituximab, Ofatumumab Obinutuzumab, and Alemtuzumab Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib mesylate, Dasatinib, Nilotinib, Ponatinib, Ruxolitinib, and Fedratinib. 3. ImmunotherapyAs the name suggests, immunotherapy works by helping the immune system work to fight cancer cells. This therapy uses substances that activate the body's immune system to work against the cancer cells: Pembrolizumab Atezolizumab 4. Radiation therapy This therapy uses radiation (high-energy rays similar to X-rays) to kill the cancer cells. This treatment uses strong beams of energy to kill focus present in the body forming cancer cells (lymph nodes) or leukemia cells or stopping them from growing. Radiation targets specific areas with cancer cells or can be applied to the whole body during a stem cell transplant.. This therapy can also be used along with other treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and surgery. 5. Stem cell transplant Also known as hematopoietic stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant, this procedure replaces the cancerous blood-forming cells with new, healthy hematopoietic cells. These healthy cells are taken from the patient (before exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy) or from a donorΓÇÖs blood or bone marrow and are infused into the patient's blood. Healthy hematopoietic cells grow and multiply forming new bone marrow and blood cells that develop into all the different types of cells your body needs (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). 6.

It can often go unnoticed for a while, and people may unknowingly spread it to others. The symptoms of syphilis change over time and appear in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary Syphilis The first symptoms usually show up 2 to 6 weeks after exposure. The most common sign is a small, painless sore called a chancre.This sore typically appears on the genitals, anus, or mouth, and is easy to overlook since itΓÇÖs painless. Swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin, often accompany the chancre. These sores usually heal on their own in 2 to 6 weeks, but the lymph nodes may stay swollen for longer. Without treatment, syphilis progresses to the next stage. Secondary Syphilis A few weeks after the chancre heals, symptoms of secondary syphilis may appear. These include a red, blotchy rash that often appears on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, along with white patches in the mouth. Other common symptoms are swollen glands, headache, fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. In some cases, hair loss may occur. Note: Because syphilis symptoms can be vague and similar to other conditions, people may overlook them. This is why syphilis is often called the \"great imitator.\" Latent Syphilis After the secondary stage, syphilis may enter a latent phase, where no symptoms are present, but the infection is still in the body. During the early latent phase (within the first year), the infection can be passed on to others through sexual contact. After a year or more, the infection is no longer contagious, but it can still progress to the final stage. Tertiary Syphilis If left untreated, syphilis can develop into tertiary syphilis years later. This stage can cause serious damage to the body, affecting the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart. Symptoms may include vision problems, dementia, difficulty with coordination, and heart disease.

Direct testing of a chancreIt typically involves taking a sample from the sore to detect the presence of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The process includes: Microscopic examination: A healthcare provider may use a microscope to examine a sample from the chancre. The sample is usually obtained by gently scraping the ulcer. If the bacterium is present, it can be seen under the microscope. Darkfield microscopy: T his is a special technique used to view the bacteria from the chancre directly. It is highly effective in detecting T. pallidum from active lesions. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): In some cases, PCR testing may be used to amplify and detect the DNA of T. pallidum from the lesion. This method is not commonly used in routine diagnosis but may be used in specific cases. Note: These tests allow for a direct diagnosis of syphilis in the early stages, even before blood tests become effective 3. Blood Tests Nontreponemal tests: These tests detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the syphilis infection, such as the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests.

Here are some differences between them which will help you in gauging which one you have. 1. Time durationThis is the first and foremost sign of sinusitis. If you suffer from a common cold you may have a runny nose for 1-2 days, followed by a stuffy nose for 2-4 days. Post this, you may start to feel better. But if you have sinus infection, then the symptoms may stay for around seven days or more. 2. Nasal dischargeAnother potentially helpful sign of sinusitis is the color of the nasal discharge. Note: A viral infection may produce a colorful discharge. However, bacteria produce greenish or yellow mucus. 3. Sinus headachesThe pressure and swelling in the sinus cause a headache. Sinus pain can also lead to dental pain, pain in the jaws and cheek and ear pain. 4. Pain in the sinusesPain is a very common symptom of sinusitis. The inflammation and swelling in the sinus cause a dull pressure, which leads to pain in your forehead, upper jaws, and teeth, either side of the nose, or between the eyes. This may gradually lead to a headache. 5. Throat irritation and coughThe sinus blockage may cause irritation in the throat. This can also lead to a persistent cough, which gets even more annoying when you are lying down to sleep. REMEMBER! The main difference is the duration of symptoms. You will most probably recover from a cold within 5-10 days. But, sinusitis can make you feel run down for 4 weeks (acute sinusitis) or for over 3 months (chronic sinusitis).**'),\n",

However, even adults in the age group of 25 to 64 years can suffer from sinus infections due to the triggers. Some of the common triggers or factors that increase your risk of sinusitis include: Respiratory tract infections. Infections of the respiratory tract like common colds may produce too much mucus which can block the opening of the sinuses. Nasal polyps or nasal bone spur can block the opening of nasal passages or sinuses. Deviated nasal septum in which the thin wall in the nose that separates the nostrils is displaced to one side thereby blocking or limiting the sinus passages. Seasonal allergies from dust, pollen etc. Conditions that prevent cilia (move back and forth to help the mucus move out of the sinuses) from working properly like dehydration, drying medications like antihistamines, and lack of sufficient humidity in the air. Respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis which causes impaired mucus transport. Smoking including passive or secondhand smoke. Enlarged adenoids. Dental infection.

This is usually based on your symptoms which also includes the duration and the severity. In some cases, your doctor might also ask you to get some tests done which includes: 1.CT Scan (PNS Coronal) or MRI (PNS)Images taken using CT or MRI can show details of your sinuses and nasal area. These might pinpoint a deep inflammation or physical blockage, such as polyps, tumors or fungi, that's difficult to detect using an endoscope. This is why a coronal CT scan or MRI is recommended for the diagnosis of sinusitis. 2. Microbial culturesThis test is requested in order to know the cause of the sinus infection in case of a bacterial or fungal infection. It is mostly advised in chronic sinusitis and in cases where the condition fails to improve or worsen even after treatment. 3. Nasal endoscopyIn this, a thin flexible tube (commonly known as an endoscope) with a light is inserted through the nose to check the inside of the sinuses. 4. Tests forAllergiesIf your doctor suspects that the condition might have been triggered due to an allergy, then allergy testing might be advised. It is a simple skin test which helps to detect the allergen that causes a flare-up. It is a quick and safe test that can help you to know about any specific allergen which can trigger a flare-up. 5. BiopsyAlthough rare, your doctor might advise a biopsy if he/she suspects fungal sinus infection which can even penetrate through the bone.

Here are some of the best ways to prevent sinusitis and stay healthy according to the CDC. 1. Always keep your hands cleanA proper hand hygiene ritual is the single most important and least expensive means of reducing the prevalence of infections. It also helps you to prevent the spread of germs and infections to others and prevent you from getting sick. 2. Be safe with vaccinationsThe role of vaccines in lowering your risk of infections cannot be underestimated. It is always recommended to receive the flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine which help you to prevent seasonal flu and pneumonia respectively. It not only boosts your immune function but also helps you to fight infections. 3. Avoid people who have colds or other upper respiratory infectionsIt goes without saying that people who suffer from viral infections or colds are at a high risk of spreading the infections to others. As these infections can trigger sinusitis, it is highly recommended that one should avoid close contact with people who have cold or other upper respiratory infections to be on a safer side. 4. Stay away from triggersIf your sinusitis is triggered by smoking then it is wise to avoid smoking including secondhand smoke. The same rule applies to triggers such as seasonal allergies, dust, etc which are known to trigger a sinus infection. 5. Avoid dry environmentsAs dry air can make things worse for your sinuses, it is recommended to use a humidifier in your home (in particular, by your bed). This is because humidity in air can help prevent nasal passages from drying out and thus, lower your risk of infections.

Here are a few remedies that you can give a try: 1.Carom (Ajwain) seeds Add one tablespoon of carom seeds (ajwain seeds) to a pot of boiling water. Place the bowl under your face and cover your head and neck with a towel so that the steam directly hits your face and does not escape. Take deep breaths to clean your sinuses. You can also add peppermint oil or sage leaves to the water and inhale for 5-10 minutes. 2.Turmeric (Haldi)The quintessential Indian spice, turmeric contains an active compound curcumin which is a very potent anti-inflammatory agent besides being a powerful antioxidant. Chewing a raw turmeric root on an empty stomach will loosen the accumulated mucus in the sinuses and let the blood vessels breathe easily thereby easing the blockage. 3. Garlic (Lehsun)It is one of the most powerful natural antibiotics and helps relieve blocked sinuses when the cause is an infection or allergy. Its active component, Allicin, not only cures the blockage but even prevents it. Have a raw garlic clove on an empty stomach every day. 4.TulsiTulsi or holy basil is a revered Ayurveda medicine that boasts of a range of health benefits. Having a few raw tulsi leaves and honey on an empty stomach boosts the immunity and fights conditions like sinus infections, common cold and blockage of sinuses. 5.Eucalyptus (nilgiri) oilEucalyptus oil is known for its decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties and provides instant relief from blocked sinuses. Add 3 to 5 drops of eucalyptus oil to boiling water in a large pot. Use a towel to cover your head and slowly inhale the steam through your nose for no more than 2 minutes at a time. Keep your eyes closed. Do it 2 times a day. Or else, just pour 1-2 drops of the oil on a clean handkerchief and inhale a few times. 6. Salt waterWarm some water and add salt.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Stroke', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content='The cause of a stroke depends on the type of stroke. Stroke is broadly classified into 3 major types namely: 1. Ischemic stroke: Most of the strokes are ischemic strokes. These types of strokes occur when the oxygen-rich blood supply to some parts of the brain gets blocked or severely restricted. As a result of the deprived blood and oxygen, the cells of that part of the brain die, and the part of the body that it controls stops working. Restriction of blood supply can happen by the following: Clogged arteries: Fat, cholesterol, and other deposits can accumulate on the walls of blood vessels. With time, these deposits calcify or harden and this build up is called plaque. The plaque clogs the blood vessels thereby narrowing the passage for blood. Blood clots: When a clot forms in a blood vessel of the brain that is already very narrow, it leads to a thrombotic stroke. When a blood clot that has formed somewhere else in the body, breaks away and travels to a blood vessel in the brain, the result is an embolic stroke or cerebral embolism. An embolic stroke can also result from an air bubble or other foreign substance in the blood that moves and blocks a blood vessel in the brain.2. Hemorrhagic stroke: In hemorrhagic stroke, a weakened blood vessel in the brain gets ruptured allowing blood to leak into the brain. This blood accumulates and compresses the surrounding brain tissue. Two types of weakened blood vessels which usually cause hemorrhagic stroke are aneurysms (balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst) and arteriovenous malformations (tangles of blood vessels). There are two types of hemorrhagic strokes: Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. ΓÇ£IntracerebralΓÇ¥ means ΓÇ£within the brainΓÇ¥, it occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood. Intracerebral strokes are usually caused by high blood pressure. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a less common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It refers to bleeding in the space between the brain and the skull. Factors like head injury, overtreatment with blood thinners, and bleeding disorders can cause subarachnoid hemorrhage.3. Transient ischemic attack (TIA): Also known as ΓÇ£mini-strokeΓÇ¥ or a ΓÇ£warning strokeΓÇ¥, it usually does not occur for more than a few minutes. A TIA is a warning sign of a future stroke, so should be considered a medical emergency, just like a major stroke. Like ischemic strokes, blood clots often cause TIAs. More than a third of people who have a TIA and donΓÇÖt get treatment have a major stroke within 1 year. Recognizing and treating TIAs can lower the risk of a major stroke in the future.Did you know?A single stroke attack can damage millions of neurons and brain cells. An acute ischemic stroke (AIS) without timely treatment leads to the loss of 4 million neurons, 12 million brain cells, and 15 billion synapses every minute!

Gender: Stroke occurs more commonly in men, but more casualties are seen in women than men due to a stroke. Family history: Heredity or genetics can influence the risk of getting a stroke. Sedentary lifestyle: Long sitting hours with very little movement or exercise is a major risk factor for stroke Excessive alcohol consumption: Excessive consumption of alcohol with more than 2 drinks per day raises blood pressure. Uncontrolled drinking can lead to stroke. Obesity: Obesity or excessive weight is a major risk factor for stroke or other cardiovascular complications. Tobacco: Narrowing of blood vessels is a common consequence of chronic use of tobacco in any form. Nicotine also increases blood pressure, which also increases the risk of stroke. Diabetes: Diabetes can lead to pathological changes in the blood vessels, therefore increasing the risk of stroke. Uncontrolled hypertension: Blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher can damage blood vessels that supply blood to the brain. Elevated red blood cell (RBC) count: High levels of red blood cells thicken the blood and predispose to formation of clots. This raises the risk for stroke. Elevated blood cholesterol and lipids: High cholesterol levels can increase buildup of plaque and lead to atherosclerosis or thickening or hardening of the arteries. This can decrease the amount of blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke. Heart conditions: Heart conditions like heart valve defects and arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythm) can cause long term damage to the heart thereby increasing risk of a stroke. Birth control pills: Also known as oral contraceptives, these drugs can also increase the risk of stroke. Extreme weather conditions: Stroke casualties occur more often during extreme temperatures or weather conditions. History of prior stroke: The risk of a second stroke increases if someone already had a stroke in the past. History of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs): TIAs are called mini-strokes. If someone has had one or more TIAs, they are at a very high risk of suffering from a stroke. ABCD2 score is a prediction rule used to determine the risk for stroke after a transient ischemic attack. The ABCD2 score is based on five parameters - age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA, and presence of diabetes. Scores for each item are added together to produce an overall result ranging between zero and seven. People found to have a high score often need to visit a specialist sooner. Interpretation of ABCD2 score isScore 1-3 (low)Score 4-5 (moderate)Score 6ΓÇô7 (high)Higher the score, the higher the risk of stroke in the near future.Take care of your life.

Complete medical history is recorded and a physical exam is done. Initial evaluationIn terms of initial evaluation, The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is the most frequently used score worldwide for assessing the clinical severity and prognosis of a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being 0.

Blood testsBlood tests can help to diagnose the factors that might have disrupted the normal flow of blood and in drafting a proper treatment plan. Blood tests are used to determine the following: Blood sugar should be detected early and both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia need be treated accordingly in time Presence of any infections Platelet counts Blood coagulation profile Lipid profile Cardiac markers2. Imaging tests Cranial (head) CT scan: This imaging technique is usually the initial test used to diagnose stroke as it shows clear, detailed images of the brain. It can display bleeding in the brain or damage to brain cells caused by a stroke. It can also detect any abnormalities along with the location or type of stroke. Computed tomographic angiography: This test uses CT technology to visualize detailed images of blood vessels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): It uses magnetic fields to find small changes in brain tissue that help to detect and diagnose stroke. It is more sensitive than CT to see the soft tissues of the brain and to localize the area of the brain affected. Magnetic resonance angiography: This technique uses MRI technology and is regarded as the gold standard for detecting blood flow through the blood vessels involved. Carotid doppler or doppler sonography : In this test, ultrasound waves help to visualize blood flow in the carotid arteries. It helps to detect the formation of plaques and fatty deposits in walls of carotid arteries. Electrical activity test: Two tests, namely electroencephalography (EEG) or evoke tests show the electrical impulses in the brain.The following heart tests are used to diagnose any heart conditions that may have caused a stroke: Electrocardiography (ECG): An ECG records the heart electrical activity and can determine any heart conditions that may have led to a stroke such as atrial fibrillation or irregular heart rhythms. Echocardiogram*: An echocardiogram uses sound waves to find a source of clots in the heart that may have traveled from the heart to the brain and caused a stroke. It also checks the function of the heart valves.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Stroke', 'section': 'Treatment'}, page_content='The treatment of stroke depends upon the type of stroke. A. Treatment for ischemic stroke 1.Fibrinolytics/thrombolytic medications: Medications that break down or dissolve the clot can restore the blood flow to the brain. Some of the common examples that belong to this class are: Alteplase ReteplaseNote:Citicoline, a neuroprotective drug, is approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, its efficacy over the currently used fibrinolytics is not known. Also, piracetam has been shown to improve learning and memory, and it may facilitate recovery and rehabilitation after a stroke. 2. Antiplatelet medications: Antiplatelet medications help to prevent the formation of a clot in the blood vessels, thereby aiding in the management and prevention of stroke. Examples are: Aspirin Clopidogrel3. Anticoagulants: Anticoagulants prevent clot formation by altering the chemical composition of the blood. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are alternatives to warfarin for high-risk patients (including those with a history of stroke) who have atrial fibrillation. The advantage of these drugs is that they dont require frequent monitoring like warfarin. Examples of NOACs include: Apixaban Rivaroxaban Dabigatran Edoxaban4. Blood pressure medications: Antihypertensives are given in stroke to maintain normal blood pressure. Some of the commonly prescribed drugs that belong to this category include: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) Diuretics Beta-blockers Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors5. Statins: This class of drug is known to help in the treatment of stroke and prevention of a second attack by reducing the cholesterol levels in the blood. Examples include: Atorvastatin Rosuvastatin Pitavastatin6. Thrombectomy: Thrombectomy refers to the procedure of removing the clot to ensure normal blood flow to the brain. 7. Carotid endarterectomy: Carotid stenosis or narrowing of the carotid artery may occur due to the deposition of fatty substances. This is a surgical procedure where an incision is made on the carotid artery to remove the deposited fatty substances. B. Treatment for hemorrhagic stroke 1. Surgery: Surgery is needed in a hemorrhagic stroke to reach the source of bleeding. Sometimes, a catheter or small tube is inserted in the arm or leg artery, guiding it to reach the brain tissue and to evaluate the problem. 2. Endovascular procedures: Endovascular procedures may be used to treat certain hemorrhagic strokes. The doctor inserts a long tube through a major artery in the leg or arm and then guides the tube to the site of the weak spot or break in a blood vessel. The tube is then used to install a device, such as a coil, to repair the damage or prevent bleeding. These are details of endovascular procedures: Surgical clipping: A surgeon places a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm to stop blood flow to it. This clamp can keep the aneurysm from bursting. Coiling (endovascular embolization): Using a catheter inserted into an artery in the groin and guided to the brain, the surgeon will place tiny detachable coils into the aneurysm to fill it.3. Surgery for hydrocephalus: In hydrocephalus, fluid accumulates around the brain. This can be treated with the help of a tube, called a shunt, to drain the excess fluid. C. Supportive treatmentIn some cases, supportive treatment measures might be required to improve the overall condition of the patient such as: Inserting a feeding tube into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube) to provide nutrition, if you have difficulty swallowing. Intravenous administration of fluids (fluids given directly into a vein), if you\\'re at risk of dehydration.Did you know?If you get to the hospital within 3 hours of the first symptoms of an ischemic stroke, you may get a type of medicine called a thrombolytic (a ΓÇ£clot-bustingΓÇ¥ drug) to break up blood clots. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a thrombolytic. Timely administration of thrombolytics in a suitably selected patient can result in quick recovery of the patient, hence the phrase \"time is brain\" is rightly justified.

The following measures can be taken to prevent stroke: 1. Dietary modifications: Eat a wholesome diet rich in green leafy vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Consume foods low in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol and high in fiber to prevent high cholesterol. Limiting salt in the diet can also lower blood pressure. Also, avoid red meat and other greasy and fatty junk foods to lower the risk of stroke. 2. Maintain healthy weight: If you are overweight/obese or have high cholesterol levels, then it is advised to lose weight to attain body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9. This can lower the risk of stroke in the future. 3. Stay active: Sedentary lifestyle is a major factor in progression of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Hence, it is recommended that you try to move as much as possible and indulge in some form of exercise most days of the week. For adults, 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity such as a brisk walk is recommended for each week. 4. Keep your blood pressure in check: High blood pressure can increase your risk of having a stroke. High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, so make sure to have it checked on a regular basis. If you have high blood pressure, proper medication, some changes in lifestyle, or foods with lower sodium can help in managing the condition. 5. Controldiabetes: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to higher risk of development of stroke, it is of paramount importance to watch your blood sugar levels. In case you have diabetes, your doctor may recommend some lifestyle changes like more physical activity or choosing healthier foods along with necessary medications. These steps will help keep blood sugar under good control and hence help lower the risk for stroke. 6. Cut down on alcohol: If you consume alcohol, it is advised either to quit or decrease it to a minimum to avoid the risk of stroke. Men should not consume more than two drinks per day, and women should have no more than one drink. 7. Quit smoking: Smoking is a strict no-no when it comes to prevention of stroke. If you donΓÇÖt smoke, donΓÇÖt start. If you do smoke, quitting will greatly reduce the risk for stroke. Your doctor can advise ways to help you quit smoking. 8.

Blood tests Creatine kinase*(CK): It is a blood test that checks the level of CK in the blood. If it is more than the normal range, it might indicate an infection in the myocardium. Total leukocyte count: Abnormal WBC (white blood cells) count can help diagnose myocarditis due to infections. CRP: Increased levels of CRP (C-reactive protein) act as an inflammatory marker which can suggest myocarditis. ESR: Elevated ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation rate) is also another marker for inflammation in the body. Troponin levels: Increased level of troponin (circulating) in the blood can indicate damage to the heart muscle. 2. Imaging tests Electrocardiography: Electrocardiogram is performed to detect the electrical activity of the heart. Chest X-ray: A chest X-ray may help to check for enlargement of the heart or accumulation of fluid in the heart's sac. Echocardiography: It uses high-pitched sound waves to produce a picture of your heart. It also helps with blood flow analysis and analysis of any valve problems, heart enlargement, and the presence of a clot within or around the heart. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A cardiac MRI uses radio waves and a magnetic field to show the size, and shape, as well as swelling, inflammation, or scarring of the heart. 3. Biopsy Cardiac catheterization involves threading a tiny tube into the heart to measure or biopsy for inflammation or infection. Biopsy is not routinely performed and is suggested in special cases of: Severe arrhythmia Conventional supportive therapy that did not work Suspected acute dilated cardiomyopathy (A heart condition that is caused due to blockage in the coronary arteries). 4. Micro-RNA profiling It checks small RNA molecules in tissues or blood to understand how genes are controlled. This test is done to detect acute and chronic myocarditis or the severity of myocardial damage. Ensure accurate diagnosis with trusted medical tests with Tata 1mg. Book Your Tests Today**\"),\n",

Strokeor heart attack :If the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of blood, there is a risk of blood clot formation in the heart. If a blood clot creates a blockage in an artery of the heart, one may suffer a heart attack. Also, if the clot travels to the brain it can cause a stroke. Arrhythmia: When the heart muscles are injured or become weak, it may lead to arrhythmia or irregular heart rhythm. Ventricular dysrhythmias: These are abnormal heart rhythms that make the lower chambers of the heart twitch instead of pump. This can limit or stop the heart from supplying blood to the body. Left ventricular aneurysm: It forms when a section of the heart muscle in the left ventricle (the chamber of the heart that pumps blood to the body) stretches and becomes very thin.

Chronic back pain makes it difficult to sit, stand, or bend for long periods of time. Weight gain: Chronic pain prevents an individual from exercising regularly, which is an essential component of living a healthy lifestyle. Weight gain is inevitable when one's movement is restricted due to back pain. Loss of bone density: Loss of bone density is caused by an increase in weight and a decrease in muscle mass. Over time, this can affect the overall posture. Muscle tissue loss: This occurs when movement is restricted due to increased pain, which reduces activity, increases weight, and reduces muscle mass. Insomnia/inability to sleep: Severe pain disrupts a person's sleep pattern, leading to insomnia. Not getting enough sleep can also lead to a bad mood, making it difficult to deal with day-to-day events. Deformity: Back pain can create the form of a hump, also known as swayback, in which the back curves inward instead of outward.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Dry Eyes', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content=\"Tears play a very important role in maintaining the overall health of the eyes by: Providing a smooth surface for optimal vision Protecting the cornea (the transparent, protective front part of the eye) Lubricating the eyes Tears form a multilayered film made of the following three layers that keep the eye smoothly lubricated: The superficial layer is made of lipids (fats or oils) lining the upper and lower eyelids. This layer seals the tear film to reduce evaporation. The middle layer is basically a dilute salt water solution. This layer helps in keeping the eyes moist, as well in flushing out any dust, debris, or foreign objects that may get into the eye. The innermost mucosa layer, made up of mucus. This mucus helps the overlying watery layer to spread evenly over the eye. Dry eyes develop when there is a problem in either of the layers, imbalance between tear production and drainage or loss of tear film stability. The various causes are discussed below in detail: 1. Inadequate amount of tears: The reduced tear volume around the eyelids is the main cause of dry eyes. The various reasons for this are: Aging Health conditions like Sj├╢gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lupus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, xerophthalmia due to Vitamin A deficiency tend to decrease tear production Medications like antihistamines, decongestants, antidepressants, antihypertensives, and oral contraceptives. 2. Excessive tear evaporation: The symptoms of dry eyes can also develop due to increased evaporation of tears. This can occur due to the following: Less blinking : Long hours of reading, driving or working on a computer can reduce blinking and trigger evaporation of tears. Conditions like Parkinson's disease also reduce the frequency of blinking. Meibomian gland dysfunction : Meibonian glands are small oil glands on the edge of the eyelids. They produce the oil/ lipid layer that forms the superficial layer of tear film that protects against evaporation of tears. Blockage of these glands, more commonly associated with conditions like rosacea, psoriasis, scalp and face dermatitis or taking oral isotretinoin medication leaves inadequate lipid/oil to cover the watery tear layer to prevent its evaporation. Blepharitis: An infection along the eyelids or the eyelashes makes the bacteria break down the oil, leaving insufficient oil to prevent any evaporative loss of tears and dry eyes. Certain health conditions: Conditions such as stroke.) or Bell's palsy, make it difficult to shut the eyes. Hence, the eyes may become dry due to tear evaporation. 3. Abnormality in the production of mucus or lipids found in the tear layer: Chemical burns to the eye or some autoimmune conditions, like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cicatricial pemphigoid can lead to abnormal production of lipids in the tear layer. This leads to poor spreading of the tears over the surface of the eye, thereby causing dryness despite the presence of sufficient tears. 4. Combination of the above factors**\"),\n",

Medical conditionsSeveral inflammatory and autoimmune conditions are also associated with an increased risk of dry eyes. They include: Rheumatoid arthritis Diabetes Thyroid dysfunction Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids) Rosacea Seborrhoeic dermatitis Staphylococcal infection Demodex mite infestation Bell's palsy SjorgenΓÇÖs syndrome Graft v/s host disease Herpes infection Hepatitis C Androgen insufficiency Heat or chemical burns Acne Gout 6. MedicationsThe use of certain medications are also closely associated with dryness of the eyes due to decreased tear production. This includes medications for high blood pressure, allergies, anxiety, depression, cough, insomnia. 7. External exposureExposure to dry climate, chemical fumes, pollution, and sun increase the risk of developing dry eyes. Smoking and secondhand smoking both are the risk factors of dry eyes as it exposes the eyes to harmful irritants. The people living in air conditioners also have a higher chance of having dry eyes. 8. Contact lensThe use of contact lenses decreases the sensation of cornea and can lead to dry eyes. 9. Previous eye surgeryAny eye surgery in the past such as LASIK (laser) surgery, lid surgery, or cataract surgery can decrease tear production and lead to dry eyes. 10. Eye dropsThe excessive use of topical medications in the eyes for some other eye conditions such as glaucoma is also associated with the risk of dry eyes. 11.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Dry Eyes', 'section': 'Diagnosis'}, page_content=\"The symptoms of dry eyes are very similar to eye infections and allergies. So, it is very necessary to distinguish between these diseases through specific clinical tests. Antiallergic medications, if given in dry eyes because of incorrect diagnosis may worsen the condition of the eye. 1.Patient history and physical examinationThe doctor takes patient history which includes information about the medications taken by patients, medical problems, and environmental factors which may contribute to the symptoms of dry eyes. The doctor also checks for: The amount of tears eyes are making The structure of eyelids Time, place, and diurnal variation of symptoms Workplace stress Living conditions (dry, dusty air and air conditioning) Systemic diseases Medication history 2. Examination of tear stability Tear break up time (TBUT)This test diagnoses how long the tear film lasts after blinking. For this, a small amount of dye is placed in the eyes. The time up to which the dyed tear film covers the whole eye after blinking is recorded. The tear film does not last long in case of Dry eyes. 3. Examination of tear volume SchrimerΓÇÖs testThis test assesses the quantity of tears produced by the eyes. In this, the eyes are desensitized by putting eye drops and then a small piece of paper is placed on the edge of the eyelid. The eyes are allowed to close for 5 minutes. The amount of moisture on the paper indicates the quantity of tears. Tear film meniscusIn this test, the height of the tear film is determined which helps in diagnosing the amount of tears produced by the eye. Tear meniscus height is 0.2 ┬▒ 0.09 mm in patients with dry eyes and 0.5 ┬▒ 0.02 mm in patients with healthy eyes. A foamy tear film is an indicator of an altered lipid layer in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction. Slit lamp testIn this, the quantity of tears produced by the eyes is measured through a microscope known as a slit lamp. A liquid is put into the eyes which helps in clear visualization of the tears. The practitioner looks in the eye and eyelids by directing a bright light into the eyes. 4. Examination of tear films Tear film osmolarityIn this, the osmolarity of tears is determined. Tear osmolarity is a measurement of the concentration of salt in the tears. Normal osmolarity is essential for normal tear production. The value of osmolarity increases with the severity of the Dry eyes. 5. Examination of the ocular surfaceThe surface of the eye is examined using a microscope (slit lamp) and dyes. Dyes help in visualizing the surface clearly. The common dyes used to study eyes are fluorescein and lissamine green. Fluorescein stainingIt is mostly used to assess corneal damage. The dye fluorescein is instilled into the tear film and studied after 1 to 3 minutes. Lissamine green stainingIt is mostly used to assess conjunctiva and lid margin damage. The dye fluorescein is instilled into the tear film and studied after 1 to 3 minutes. 6. Examination of eye-lids Blink rateBlinking plays a very significant role in keeping the eye moist by distributing the tear fluid over the eye surface. The normal blink rate is: While speaking : 15.5 ┬▒ 13.7 blinks/minute During reading and computer work : 5.3 ┬▒ 4.5 blinks/minute The reduced interval between blinks by about 2.6 to 6 seconds indicates dry eyes. Meibomian gland evaluationMeibomian glands play a very significant role in maintaining overall health and stability of the eye. The gland produces meibum, the reduction of which can cause evaporative Dry eyes due to altered lipid composition. The function of the meibomian gland can be determined by evaluating meibum quantity and quality. The turbid and viscous appearance of meibum indicates dysfunction of the gland. Differentiating between insufficient tear production and excessive tear evaporationThe above tests also help in determining the cause of dry eyes: The reduced tear meniscus and low schirmer test indicates deficiency of tears. Altered lid margins, thickened meibomian gland secretion, reduced tear film break up time are an indicator of hyper evaporative dry eye. Ocular surface damage and elevated tear film osmolarity can occur with both forms. Evaluation for systemic diseaseThere are various diseases that may cause dry eyes, particularly primary Sjogren's syndrome. In various cases secondary Sjogren syndrome caused by other conditions may also cause dry eyes. Such conditions include: Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus Progressive systemic sclerosis Dermatomyositis Other systemic abnormalities such as Parkinson's disease, androgen deficiency, thyroid disease, and diabetes have also been associated with Dry eyes.

They are benzalkonium chloride (preservative) free eye drops that are designed to increase the tear film stability. They are the preparations containing polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl guar, cellulose derivatives, and hyaluronic acid as the main agent. These drops are available in the form of gels, ointments, and solutions. In case of meibomian gland dysfunction, artificial tears containing lipids such as triglycerides, phospholipids, and castor oil are used. 2. Anti-inflammatory medicationsInflammation in the ocular surface and lacrimal gland is observed even in moderately severe dry eyes.

But, this therapy is used only for short-term use as long term therapy is associated with some complications. 4. Topical cyclosporine ACyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that aids in reducing inflammation. Topical application of cyclosporine increases production of tear and also reduces symptoms like blurry vision, ocular dryness, and foreign body sensation. In case of cyclosporine intolerant patients, tacrolimus eye drops are used. 5. AntibioticsSeveral antibiotics with anti-inflammatory properties are also used to treat Dry eyes. They are used in case of meibomian gland dysfunction and blepharitis associated with Dry eyes. Some of the common antibiotics used for dry eyes are: Doxycycline Minocycline Azithromycin 6. Punctal plugsThese are tiny devices that are inserted into the tear ducts of the eye. They reduce drainage of the tears that help in keeping the eye moist.

Anaphylaxis treatment includes: MedicationsThe medications used to treat an anaphylactic reaction include: Adrenaline*(Epinephrine): This is the first line of treatment recommended for patients with anaphylaxis. This drug can be life-saving as it plays an important role in delaying the progression of life-threatening reactions. Antihistamines: Antihistamines reduce inflammation in air passages and also improve breathing. H1 antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or cetirizine can also relieve itching and hives. Beta antagonist: They are used for airways protection and to relieve respiratory tract symptoms. Glucocorticoids: Steroids (glucocorticoids) are often recommended in anaphylaxis. They reduce the severity of the acute reaction and the risk of recurrence. For hospital-based patientsPatients who have been moved to a hospital set up and stabilized, the following agents are used: Activated charcoal: The solution is commonly used to treat poison victims, and also to treat people with peanut allergies. Drinking activated charcoal immediately after accidental exposure to peanuts can block further absorption of allergy-causing proteins in the body and reduce the severity of the allergic reaction. Vasopressors: Norepinephrine, vasopressin and other pressors are helpful in patients suffering from anaphylaxis with refractory hypotension (persistent hypotension in resuscitated patients) Glucagon: It is an anti-hypoglycemic used to manage and treat anaphylaxis refractory to epinephrine, and aid in passing food boluses. Intravenous fluids: These are administered to maintain adequate blood circulation. In case of emergencyIf you are with someone who is having an allergic reaction with signs of anaphylaxis, here are things you need to do: Call the local medical emergency number immediately. See If the person is carrying an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) to treat an allergic attack. Help the person inject the medication by pressing the autoinjector against the person's thigh. Make the person lie face up and be still. Loosen their tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket. Turn the person to the side to prevent choking if there's vomiting or bleeding from the mouth. Position the patient in the Trendelenburg position i.e lying flat on the back with legs elevated in order to allow blood flow to the heart.

If the blood flow to the heart is not restored quickly it can cause permanent damage to the muscles, leading to a heart attack. Myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, discomfort in the back, sweating, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath. In case of a suspected heart attack, the person should be given aspirin and rushed to a hospital immediately. One should not wait for symptoms to settle. The earlier the person is rushed to the hospital, the better are the chances of survival. A heart attack can be treated with medications and in some cases, surgery might be required. The chances of a second heart attack can be prevented with simple lifestyle modifications, regular check-ups and medications.'),\n",

However, there are certain modifiable causes of heart attack which can help you prevent and lower your risk of heart attack if known. Some of the modifiable risk factors of a heart attack are: 1.High blood pressure High blood pressure puts excess strain on the blood vessels which over time causes constriction of the blood vessels. This impacts the blood flow to the heart and increases the risk of heart attacks. The damage increases further due to the buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances in the coronary arteries. 2.Diabetes If your blood glucose levels are not under control, it can cause inflammation of these blood vessels, which further affects the blood flow through these vessels. As the blood flow becomes sluggish, over time it can damage the heart muscle and increase the risk of a heart attack. Are your blood glucose levels under control? Check it now! Click Here! 3. Cholesterol If excess cholesterol gets deposited in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, it is a cause of concern. This overtime can block the blood flow to the heart either partially or completely, which in turn, causes a heart attack.Get your cholesterol level checked with a single click. Book Test Here! 4. Smoking When you smoke, you inhale various harmful chemicals present in cigarettes.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Heart Attack', 'section': 'Diagnosis'}, page_content=\"If you experience pain in the chest or discomfort, then your doctor might advise some blood and imaging tests to determine the underlying cause. A. Lab testsSome of the commonly advised lab tests include: 1.Lipid Profile Test This is a group of blood tests that detects the levels of different types of lipids in the blood. Lipids are fatty substances that play an important role in a number of body functions. Apart from being structural components of the cells, lipids also act as a source and mode of storage of energy for the body. It typically measures the levels of total cholesterol, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Other results that may be reported include Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. 2.C-reactive protein (CRP) test C-reactive Protein (CRP) is a protein secreted by the liver in response to inflammation caused by injury, infection, or otherwise. The C-reactive protein (Quantitative) test measures the levels of C-reactive protein in blood to determine the presence of inflammation or infection and to monitor treatment. 3. Cardiac troponins (I and T) Troponins are proteins which are found in the heart muscles and skeletal muscle fibres. These are known to help regulate muscular contraction. This test helps measure the level of cardiac-specific troponin in the blood thereby helping in the diagnosis of any heart injury or damage. 4.Creatine kinase (CK) Also known as Total CK, Creatine Phosphokinase, and CPK test, this test is done to detect and monitor damage to muscle. It is also done to diagnose conditions which are associated with muscle damage and to detect any possible case of heart attack. A more specific test known as Creatine Kinase-MB (CKMB) is also recommended.This test measures the enzyme Creatine Kinase (CK) MB, which is mainly found in cells of heart muscles, in blood. It is also found in skeletal muscles but in a lesser amount. 5.Myoglobin This assay is useful for assessing muscle damage from any cause. Elevated myoglobin levels are seen in cases of acute muscle injury, resuscitation, myopathies, shock & strenuous body activity. B. Imaging & other testsIn addition to the blood work, some of the other tests that can help in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction or a blockage in the heart include: 1.Electrocardiogram (EKG / ECG): This resting 12 lead ECG test is the first-line diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It should be obtained within 10 minutes of the patientΓÇÖs arrival in the emergency department. Acute MI is often associated with dynamic changes in the ECG waveform. Serial ECG monitoring can provide important clues to the diagnosis if the initial EKG is non-diagnostic at initial presentation. 2. Holter monitoring or ambulatory ECG or ambulatory EKG: A holter monitor is a small, wearable device that keeps track of your heart rhythm. This monitoring is used to diagnose intermittent cardiac arrhythmias. 3.Echocardiography: A cardiac echo is used to identify abnormalities in the heart's structure and function. 4.Stress test:This test involves measuring the performance of the heart while undergoing exercise of gradually increasing intensity on a treadmill. 5.Carotid ultrasound: A carotid ultrasound is an important test that can detect narrowing, or stenosis of the carotid arteries. Carotid artery stenosis is a major risk factor for stroke. 6. Tilt table test: The tilt table test (also called a passive head-up tilt test or head upright tilt test) records your blood pressure, heart rhythm and heart rate on a beat-by-beat basis 7.MRI of the heart: A heart MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses magnets and radio waves to create an image of your heart and nearby blood vessels. 8.Cardiac CT: The Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of heart is an imaging test which is used to create a detailed three dimensional image of the heart and coronary blood vessels and helps to assess the condition of the blood vessels and understand blood flow through them and help to diagnose various heart diseases. 9.Coronary angiography: A coronary angiogram is a procedure that uses X-ray imaging to check the heart's blood vessels. 10. Cardiac catheterization: Cardiac catheterization (cardiac cath or heart cath) is a procedure to examine the working of the heart. A thin, hollow tube called a catheter is inserted into a large blood vessel that leads to your heart to find out the origin of disease of the heart muscle, valves or coronary (heart) arteries. 11. Radionuclide ventriculography or radionuclide angiography (MUGA Scan): A radionuclide angiogram is a test used to gather images of the heart throughout its pumping cycle it is also referred to as a MUGA scan (multigated acquisition scan) or blood pool scan. 12. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): TEE is a test that produces pictures of the heart. TEE uses high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to make detailed pictures of your heart and the arteries surrounding it. C. Nuclear heart scansSimilar to angiography, these scans use a radioactive dye injected into your blood. What sets them apart from an angiogram is that they use computer-enhanced methods like computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans. 1.Positron emission tomography (PET) scan: This test uses radioactive dyes to produce pictures of the heart. PET scans differentiate between healthy and damaged heart muscles. 2. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): A SPECT scan uses radioactive tracers that are injected into blood to produce pictures of the heart to check how well blood is flowing to the heart. 3.Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) test: This test shows how well blood flows through your heart muscle. It also helps to show areas of the heart muscle that arenΓÇÖt getting enough blood.\"),\n",

Do not ignore symptoms of heart disease The most common symptom is a chest pain (angina) which originates in the center of the chest area, behind the breastbone, is typical of a heart attack. Moreover, a chest pain which occurs after walking some distance which was not experienced initially can also indicate a heart attack. Other common symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating, and pain or discomfort in the jaw, arms, and shoulder. So if you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is recommended to immediately go to a hospital or consult a doctor at the earliest. 2. Go for regular health check-ups Diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol level are one of the key factors that put you at risk of heart disease. This is the reason why every person who suffers from high blood glucose level, high blood pressure and high cholesterol level should get a regular health check-up done every year. It goes without saying that the frequency to get a health check-up increases as you age and for people with a family history of heart disease.Ideally, it is better to get a heart checkup done once you cross 45 years of age, but with increasing incidence in young people (above 30 years), even young adults should get a health check-up every year without fail.

However, using these medicines more often than not is not a good idea as it might lead to health complications and side-effects. Studies have reported that long-term opioid therapy can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases, especially myocardial infarction. Self-medication without consulting your doctor is not at all recommended as it might lead to harmful side-effects. Your doctor will weigh the pros and cons of the medication based on your overall health and condition. So think twice before you blindly take any medication without informing your doctor as it might affect you later. It is not advised to consult a chemist or self-medicate for any heart disease. 4. Maintain a good relationship with your family doctor One of the key reasons why most patients fail to consult a doctor and search the internet for information pertaining to their condition is the lack of a good relationship between their family doctor. Most people do not feel comfortable to ask their doctor about problems that affect them on a day to day basis, which according to them are silly things. Even to know why a particular medication is recommended to them, they will go online but not ask their doctor because it is a silly reason to ask. This is not right.

Exercise is the key to keep your heart healthy Most of us have a very tight schedule which makes it difficult to spend the time exercising. Although people are turning out to be health conscious and hitting the gym to burn calories and stay fit, it becomes difficult to exercise regularly. But if you are at risk of heart disease or are planning to keep your heart healthy, ensure you lead an active lifestyle. This doesnΓÇÖt include exercising day in and out but ensuring you workout daily or at least walk every day is enough. You can walk for 30 ΓÇô 45 minutes for five days a week or walk 10,000 steps a day to stay healthy.6. Diet for healthy heart A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins, fiber, and fats can help you keep your heart healthy. Whole grains: Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are considered to be one of the great natural sources of fiber. They contain soluble fibrous phytosterols which not only decreases the absorption of fat and sugar in the small intestine but also helps to lower the level of triglycerides in the blood. Good sources of soluble fiber are oats, barley, legumes, and psyllium husks. Fruits: Fruits and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidants that protect the circulating cholesterol from oxidation which can cause free radical generation. These free radicals can negatively affect the overall health and increase the level of cholesterol in the blood, thereby offering an overall protective effect for the heart. Eat more vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, and celery as well as potatoes with skin. Fish: According to the American Heart Association, eating two servings of fatty fish per week is good for the heart. Include fatty fish rich in omega-3 fats such as salmon, herring, sardines, mackerel and tuna in the diet to improve your triglyceride levels and keep cholesterol in control. Garlic: Garlic not only lowered triglyceride levels but it also reduced total cholesterol levels. Moreover, it also helps to regulate glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion aiding to keep your blood glucose levels in check along with triglycerides. Nuts: Nuts are undoubtedly one of the best sources of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and unsaturated fats, all of which are heart-healthy nutrients. As these are obtained from trees, they are rich in plant fats, sterols, and nutrients which are good for overall health.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Heart Attack', 'section': 'Treatment'}, page_content='Depending on the condition and the extent of the block, your doctor might advise medications or recommend surgery. A. MedicationsHeart attack treatment involves a variety of drugs. Your doctor will recommend the best combination of heart attack medications for your situation. Some of the common drugs include: 1. Thrombolytic drugsThrombolytic or clot-busting medications are intravenous (IV) medications that cause blood clots to break down and dissolve. These medications are usually used only within the first 12 hours after a heart attack. Examples of this class of drugs include: Streptokinase Alteplase Urokinase 2. AnticoagulantsAnticoagulants, commonly known as blood thinners, are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood, prolonging the clotting time. Examples of this class of drugs include: Apixaban Dabigatran Heparin Rivaroxaban Warfarin 3. Antiplatelet agentAntiplatelet agents are medicines that reduce the ability of platelets to stick together (called platelet aggregation) and inhibit the formation of blood clots. These are also known as platelet agglutination inhibitors or platelet aggregation inhibitors. Drugs that belong to this class are: Aspirin Clopidogrel Prasugrel Ticagrelor 4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitorsThese inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme which regulates salt and water retention in the body. They also lower blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels, decreasing blood volume and increasing sodium excretion in the urine. ACE inhibitors are recommended in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, or heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes. A few examples in this class of drugs are: Fosinopril Captopril Enalapril Ramipril Lisinopril Benazepril 5. Angiotensin receptor blockersIf you are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors, ARBs are used. They block angiotensin-II (a hormone which causes your blood vessel to constrict) from binding to its receptor and antagonize its action. This helps reduce your blood pressure. Some examples in this class of drugs are: Telmisartan Losartan Valsartan Irbesartan Fimasartan Olmesartan 6. Beta blockersBeta-blockers are recommended in patients with LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) less than 40% if no other contraindications are present. Examples of some of the drugs in this class are: Atenolol Metoprolol Propranolol Oxprenolol Labetalol 7. Combined alpha and beta blockersThis type of heart disease medication helps lower blood pressure. It does this by slowing your heart rate and reducing nerve impulses that tell vessels to tighten. Examples of combined alpha- and beta-blockers include Carvedilol Labetalol 8. Calcium channel blockersThey bind to calcium channels in the blood vessels and block the entry of calcium. This causes dilatation of the blood vessels which helps decrease blood pressure. Some of the commonly used calcium channel blockers include Amlodipine Nifedipine Clevidipine Verapamil Diltiazem 9. Statins (cholesterol lowering agents)It works by reducing the amount of ΓÇ£badΓÇ¥ cholesterol (LDL) and raising the amount of ΓÇ£goodΓÇ¥ cholesterol (HDL) in your blood. Statins block the enzyme in the liver that is responsible for making cholesterol. Lowering the amount of cholesterol reduces the chances of heart diseases and helps you remain healthier for longer. Some of the commonly prescribed cholesterol lowering medications include: Atorvastatin Lovastatin Rosuvastatin 10. DiureticsDiuretics like hydrochlorothiazide eliminate excess salt and water from the body and also decrease calcium excretion. There are different types of diuretics that act at different sites of the renal tubules (small tubes) in the nephrons (functional unit of kidney). A few types of diuretics used in the treatment of hypertension are Hydrochlorothiazide Chlorthalidone Furosemide Triamterene Amiloride 11. VasodilatorsIt helps to lower blood pressure by widening the blood vessels and decreasing their resistance thereby helping the blood to pass through more easily. Hydralazine and minoxidil are vasodilators that work directly on the vessel walls to decrease blood pressure. Nitroglycerin which is used to relieve chest pain is a powerful vasodilator. B. Surgery1. Percutaneous coronary intervention Also known as coronary angioplasty, it is a nonsurgical procedure that improves blood flow to your heart. This procedure uses a catheter-based device inserted into a major blood vessel (usually one near your upper thigh). Once the catheter is inserted into the blood vessel through a small incision, the technician threads it up to the blocked artery on your heart. Once it reaches the location of the blockage, the technician will inflate a small balloon on the end of the device to widen the blood vessel and clear the blockage. Angioplasty is often combined with the placement of a small wire mesh tube called a stent. The stent helps prop the artery open, decreasing its chance of narrowing again. Most stents are coated with medication to help keep the artery open (drug-eluting stents). 2. Bypass surgery In this, a surgeon takes a section of healthy blood vessels, often from inside the chest wall or from the lower leg, and attaches the ends above and below the blocked artery so that blood flow is redirected around the narrowed part of the diseased artery. With a new pathway, blood flow to the heart muscle improves. Patients who have severe blockages of their coronary arteries undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. This surgery is often called open-heart surgery, bypass surgery or CAB. This is useful in treating blocked heart arteries by creating new passages for blood to flow to your heart muscle. 3. Atherectomy It is similar to angioplasty except that the catheter has a rotating shaver on its tip to cut away plaque from the artery. Once the catheter is inserted into the blood vessel through a small incision, the provider threads it up to the blocked artery on your heart. Once it reaches the location of the blockage, the provider will inflate a small balloon on the end of the device to widen the blood vessel and clear the blockage. 4. Implantable medical devices These include pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) which help to control the heart rhythm and ventricular assist devices which support the heart and blood circulation. Pacemaker: It is a small battery-operated device which helps your heart to beat in a regular pattern. Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICDs): It is a small battery-powered device placed in your chest to detect and stop abnormal heartbeats. This device delivers electric shocks inside the heart to restore a normal heart rhythm. Ventricular assist devices (VADs): This is also known as a mechanical circulatory support device, which is an implantable mechanical pump that helps pump blood from the lower chambers of your heart (the ventricles) to the rest of your body. 5. Other surgeries Cardiomyoplasty: An experimental procedure in which healthy skeletal muscles are taken from a patientΓÇÖs back or abdomen and wrapped around the heart to provide support for the failing heart. Radiofrequency ablation: A catheter with an electrode at its tip is guided through the veins to the heart muscle to carefully create tiny scars in the heart to block abnormal electrical signals and correct heart arrhythmias. Transmyocardial revascularization (TMR): A laser is used to create a series of channels from the outside of the heart into the heartΓÇÖs pumping chamber. Heart transplant:** In this procedure a diseased heart is removed and replaced with a donated healthy human heart.'),\n",

Factor concentrates Plasma-derived: They are prepared from the donor blood. It is used to control spontaneous bleeding due to its rapid action. A common example is human coagulation factor VIII. Recombinant factors: Plasma-derived products are more susceptible to viral infections (HIV and hepatitis). To overcome this recombinant clotting factors are used which serve the same purpose. Blood transfusion The whole blood is also used to control bleeding as it contains all the clotting factors. Adjuvant therapies Tranexamic acid: It works by blocking the breakdown of blood clots, which prevents bleeding. It is mainly used to control mucosal bleeding. Desmopressin (DDAVP): It works by releasing stored Factor VIII from blood vessels. It is used mainly in mild hemophilia. Fibrin sealant: It is available as sprays that are meant to be applied on open wounds to control bleeding. Factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA): It is composed of the clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Antispasmodic analgesics: These are used to control pain during the bleeding episode. The common examples are Paracetamol Dextropropoxyphene Codeine Buprenorphine Tramadol Aminocaproic acid: It prevents blood clots and is mainly prescribed before dental surgery. It is also given to manage nose and mouth bleeds. Calcium alginate: It is derived from seaweed and is used in dressings of wound repair. Novel therapies Gene therapy: A gene is a basic unit of information that directs cells to produce proteins; gene therapy aims to correct diseases by introducing functional genes, though it's costly and has limited application. Monoclonal antibodies (non-factor replacement therapies): They are proteins made in labs that work in the same manner as that of the body's protein. One available therapy is emicizumab. Hemostatic rebalancing therapies: These aim to restore the natural balance in blood clotting by correcting deficiencies or imbalances.

Topical medicationsCorticosteroids are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. Topical medications are available as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, sprays and shampoos. Topical corticosteroids might be applied once a day during flares, and on alternate days or weekends only to maintain remission. Retinoic acid is available as a gel and cream and applied once or twice daily. The most common side effects are skin irritation and increased sensitivity to light. These are not recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding. Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus reduce inflammation and plaque buildup. They can be helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are too irritating or may cause harmful effects. Other topical medications used are salicylic acid and coal tar. Salicylic acid is used to get rid of dead skin cells while coal tar works by reducing inflammation and scaling. 2. Light therapy This psoriasis treatment uses natural or artificial ultraviolet light. It involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light either alone or in combination with medications. Ultraviolet (UV) light, which is found in sunlight, slows the rapid growth of skin cells. 3. Oral and injectable medications**When psoriasis becomes severe, the doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. These include: 1. Methotrexate: Usually administered weekly as a single oral dose, methotrexate decreases the production of skin cells and suppresses inflammation. People taking methotrexate long term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood counts and liver function. Men and women should stop taking methotrexate at least three months before attempting to conceive. This drug is not recommended when you're breast-feeding. 2. Retinoids: Retinoids are pills used to reduce the production of skin cells. These are not recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding. 3. Ciclosporin: It treats psoriasis by suppressing the immune system. Cyclosporin increases your risk of infection and cancer. People taking cyclosporine need ongoing monitoring of their blood pressure and kidney function. These drugs are not recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding. 4.

Only two of these are related to urinary tract infections (UTIs). The signs and symptoms of prostatitis vary depending on the cause. Moreover, many symptoms of prostatitis are common to those of other conditions. Based on the type of prostatitis, the symptoms which a person may experience are: Type 1: Acute bacterial infection or acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP)Type 1 prostatitis is an acute bacterial infection. Its signs & symptoms have an abrupt onset and it is caused by an ascending urinary tract infection. This means that the bacteria which cause the urinary tract infection travels up the urethra and infect the surrounding areas, including the prostate gland. The symptoms of type 1 prostatitis include: Fever Myalgia (muscle pain) Malaise (generalized feeling of being unwell) Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) like urgency, frequency, and dysuria (burning sensation) Nocturia (frequent urination during periods of sleep) Nausea and vomiting Pain, which may be severe, in or around your penis, testicles, anus, lower abdomen or lower back ΓÇô pooing can be painful Pain when peeing, needing to pee frequently (particularly at night), problems starting or \"stop-start\" peeing, an urgent need to pee and, sometimes, blood in your urine Lower back pain and pain on ejaculation Type 2: Chronic bacterial infection or chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP)The symptoms of type 2 prostatitis or CBP are similar to ABP (type 1), except the symptoms are chronic, recurrent, and less severe. It is caused by a bacterial infection, specifically by recurrent urinary tract infections and previous ABP. Often, if type 1 prostatitis is not appropriately treated, it develops into type 2 prostatitis. In this condition, the bacteria may form a biofilm that helps them adhere to tissues of the prostate gland. This gelatinous film also protects the bacteria from antibiotics and immune system attacks. The symptoms of type 2 prostatitis include: Pain during and after ejaculation Sexual dysfunction Infertility A weak or an interrupted urine stream Urinary blockage An enlarged or tender prostate on rectal examination Sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or pelvic pain after sex Type 3: Chronic sterile inflammation/chronic pelvic pain syndromeType 3 prostatitis is the most common prostatitis. It is called sterile prostatitis because it is not caused by bacterial infection, and so it does not have type 1 and type 2 symptoms like increased urgency and frequency of urination. Chronic sterile inflammation is caused by the obstruction of the urinary bladder outlet or by reflux of urine within the prostate gland due to enlarged prostate or some stone in the way. Symptoms are similar to type 2 prostatitis but also include: Chronic pelvic pain may affect the penis, scrotum, and perineum areas Urinary retention Difficulty in passing urine A weak or an interrupted urine stream Type 4: Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitisType 4 prostatitis is asymptomatic, i.e., it has no condition indicating symptoms.

Bacterial prostatitis is generally more difficult to treat than a simple urinary tract infection and often requires a prolonged course of antibiotics. In certain cases, the underlying cause of prostatitis may not be found, and it may be a reflection of inflammatory changes around the nerves causing pain arising from the pelvis. In such a situation, treatment often requires a more multidisciplinary approach involving physicians, urologists, and microbiologists, who try to understand the individualΓÇÖs condition in-depth and ensure that it's adequately treated.

Additional testing can be used to discover what is causing the increased PSA levels. Prostatitis is a condition that doctors aren't always clear about. The most common causes vary based on whether the condition is acute or chronic, infectious or inflammatory. An infection in your urinary tract is sometimes to blame. Sometimes, it's because of an injury or nerve damage. In many situations, doctors are unable to discover the root problem. As a result, treating prostatitis might be difficult. It might take months, if not years, for some patients to recover. 1. Maintain good hygiene: To avoid infection, keep your pelvic area and the surrounding around it clean. 1. Stand up when possible: Extended durations of sitting put pressure on your prostate gland, which can cause inflammation over time. 1. Move a lot: Make it a habit to exercise at least three times every week. Take regular walks, stretch, or go to the gym for a cardio class to get your blood flowing. Physical exercise can help lower anxiety, which has been related to some kinds of prostatitis. 1. Stay hydrated: Some kinds of prostatitis are caused by bacteria in the urinary tract that invades and infects the prostate gland. Drink plenty of fluids to keep urine diluted and the bladder flushed. If you have a medical condition such as chronic renal disease or congestive heart failure, consult your doctor to know about additional precautions you should follow. 1. Eat more fruits and green vegetables: Fruits and vegetables are high in nutrients to maintain health and fight infections and inflammation. 1. Limit or avoid caffeine and alcohol: Tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcoholic beverages can irritate the urinary system and bladder. 1. Manage stress: Men who experience high stress levels at work or home are more prone to develop prostatitis. Consult with a doctor to manage your emotions. Meditation and relaxation to release the tension of the body and mind may also help. 1. Practice safe sex: Prostatitis can be caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Bacterial infection can be caused by oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse with an infected partner without using a condom. 1. Maintain healthy body weight: Being obese puts pressure on the prostate gland. Try to lose weight by eating a good diet, being athletic, and getting adequate rest. 1.

With the UPOINT method, the condition of over 80% of males with CPPS has improved. The method is focused on these symptoms and treatments: Urinary: Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are alpha blockers which relax the muscles around the prostate and bladder to increase urine flow. Psychosocial: Stress/anxiety management can be beneficial. Counseling or medicine for anxiety, depression, and negative thinking can help some men. Organ-specific: Quercetin may reduce prostate inflammation and may help to ease an inflamed prostate gland or prostatitis. Infection-related: Antibiotics medicines help kill infection-causing bacteria. Neurological: Prescription pain relievers such as amitriptyline, pregabalin, and gabapentin help treat neurogenic pain. This pain may involve fibromyalgia or pain that spreads into the legs, arms, or back. Tenderness: Gentle massage to ease tension on tight pelvic floor muscles. This treatment can help to lessen or eliminate muscular spasms.To treat acute & chronic bacterial prostatitis Antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, macrolides & tetracyclines are recommended. The dose and duration of treatment depends on the type of prostatitis. Surgical drainage of abscesses can also help in case of inflammation and ease the symptoms. Alpha-blockers are also recommended as they help to relax the muscles around the prostate and the base of the bladder. Anti-inflammatory agents are non-steroidal drugs to reduce pain from inflammation in the prostate or muscles. These are pain medicines (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.) and muscle relaxers.Other treatmentsYou may also require one of the following therapies at some point: 1. Urinary catheter: If you cannot urinate, a nurse may help empty your bladder by inserting a flexible tube into your urethra (the tube that takes urine from your body). 1. Prostate massage: This helps remove fluid from your prostate ducts (tubes). Getting it done twice or three times a week may be beneficial. Frequent ejaculation (the release of semen during orgasm) may help just as much. 1. Pelvic floor physical therapy: Prostatitis can be linked to problems with your pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor physical therapy is a way to learn how to relax certain muscles in your pelvis. It is done with an expert to help you lessen tension in your pelvic floor muscles. These aid with sexual function and support your bladder and intestines. 1. Mental health therapy: Stress, depression, and a sense of helplessness may all play a role in some kinds of prostatitis.

Here is an overview of the common treatment modalities: 1. SurgeryIf the tumor is of significant size, surgery might be advised for its removal. The specific surgical approach will be determined by the cancer's location. Various surgical approaches include: Laser surgery: Early-stage tumors may be treated with laser surgery, a minimally invasive procedure that uses a laser beam to remove or vaporize cancerous tissue. Cordectomy: Part or all of the vocal cords are removed, suitable for small or surface-level glottic cancers. Speech changes may occur, ranging from hoarseness with partial removal to the loss of speech if both vocal cords are removed. Minimally invasive or endoscopic surgery: It involves the removal of entire tumors through the mouth, eliminating the need for external incisions and minimizing impacts on speech and swallowing functions. Vocal cord stripping: When cancer or pre-cancer is limited to the surface of the vocal cords, this surgical procedure removes the cancer and superficial layers of tissue. After this operation, most individuals can regain normal speech. Partial laryngectomy: In cases where the cancer is confined to a specific part of the larynx, a portion of the larynx may be removed while preserving vocal function. Total laryngectomy: In advanced cases, the entire larynx may need to be removed, necessitating lifestyle adjustments and potentially impacting speech and breathing. Reconstructive surgery may be performed to restore some functions. 2. ChemotherapyFollowing throat cancer surgery, chemotherapy may be employed to eradicate any remaining tumor cells. It involves the administration of drugs that circulate throughout the body, targeting and eliminating cancer cells. Often, it is combined with radiation therapy in a treatment approach known as chemoradiation, aiming to enhance overall effectiveness. Drugs used for chemotherapy include: Carboplatin Paclitaxel Oxaliplatin Capecitabine Docetaxel Cisplatin 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 3. Radiation therapy External beam radiation: High-energy beams are directed at the cancer from outside the body to destroy cancer cells. This can be the primary treatment or used post-surgery to eliminate residual cancer cells. Internal beam radiation (Brachytherapy): Radioactive sources are placed directly into or near the tumor, delivering targeted radiation. It is often used in combination with external beam radiation. 4. Targeted therapy In this therapy, targeted drugs may be used in combination with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for certain cases of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. It targets specific molecules involved in cancer growth. Cetuximab is the most commonly used drug. 5. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy enhances the body's immune system, enabling it to identify and eliminate cancer cells. Drugs used are: Pembrolizumab NivolumabOrdering medicines has never been easier.

Difficulty swallowing or speaking: Throat cancer, depending on its stage and location, can impair the normal function of the throat and vocal cords. Malnutrition: Difficulty swallowing and changes in taste can contribute to malnutrition. Infections: Weakened immune defenses from cancer treatments can make patients more susceptible to infections, including respiratory and oral infections. Airway obstruction: It may occur due to the tumor's growth, leading to breathing difficulties and potentially necessitating interventions like a tracheostomy to maintain an open airway. Oral mucositis: It is inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the oral cavity. It is a common side effect of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Tissue fibrosis: It is the scarring of healthy tissues in the throat that can result from radiation therapy leading to reduced flexibility, impaired function, and complicating swallowing and speaking. Reduced salivation: This is reduced saliva production, often due to radiation therapy, which can lead to dry mouth increasing the risk of dental issues.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Ear Pain', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content=\"Injury, infection, and irritation in the ear are the common causes of ear pain. I. Ear infectionIt is usually caused by bacteria and often begins after a child has a sore throat, cold, or other upper respiratory infection. The ear has three major parts -- the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. If the upper respiratory infection is bacterial, the same bacteria may spread to the middle ear and if the upper respiratory infection is caused by a virus, such as a cold, bacteria may move into the middle ear as a secondary infection. Outer ear infection: The outer ear, also called the pinna, includes everything we see on the outside; it is the curved flap of the ear leading down to the earlobe. The outer ear infection is caused by swimming, wearing headphones that damage the skin inside the ear canal, or putting cotton swabs in the ear canal. Middle ear infection: The middle ear is located between the eardrum and the inner ear. The infection can start from a respiratory tract infection and leads to a buildup of fluid behind the eardrums caused by the infections. Inner ear infection: This part contains the labyrinth, which helps in maintaining balance. The other part is the cochlea, a part of the labyrinth, which is a snail-shaped organ that converts sound vibrations from the middle ear into electrical signals. The infection of the inner ear is labyrinthitis which is sometimes caused by viral or bacterial infections from respiratory illnesses. II. Symptoms of other conditions Ear pain with a toothache in children who are teething. Individuals with an infected tooth having an abscess or impacted wisdom teeth are more likely to have an ear pain. Ear pain with a change in hearing, earwax build-up, an object stuck in the ear (do not try to remove it yourself ΓÇô see a GP), and perforated eardrum (particularly after a loud noise or accident). Ear pain with pain when swallowing in case of sore throat, tonsillitis, and quinsy (a complication of tonsillitis). Ear pain with a fever, flu, cold or sinusitis. III. Ear waxIt is part of the body's protective mechanism to lubricate the ear canal and prevent infection. If the wax hardens and builds excessively, it may cause significant ear pain, if the wax presses against the eardrum. IV. Insertion of a foreign objectWhen a foreign body is inserted into the ear, it causes pain and inflammation. These may include hairpins and pointed objects that are often used to scratch or remove ear wax. V. Certain medical conditions: 1. Meniere's disease Meniere's disease is caused by excess fluid buildup in the inner ear, although the exact reason behind this fluid retention is not known. Along with the classic triad of symptomsΓÇövertigo, ringing in the ears, and hearing loss -- some people with Meniere's disease report ear pain or pressure. 2. TumorsAlthough not common, a tumor may be the reason behind a person's ear pain. For example, nasopharyngeal cancer (a type of head and neck cancer) may cause ear fullness, along with hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and recurrent ear infections. Two examples of benign (noncancerous) tumors or growths that may develop in the ear and cause pain include: Cholesteatoma: A benign skin growth that forms in the middle ear. Acoustic neuroma: A benign inner ear tumor that develops on the vestibular nerve (eighth cranial nerve). 3. Other causes include Some of the other causes of ear pain include: Change in pressure, such as when flying on a plane Temporomandibular joint (the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull) syndrome Arthritis affecting the jaw Eczema in the ear canal Trigeminal neuralgia (chronic facial nerve pain) Thyroid inflammation Carotid artery pain (carotidynia) Learn more about the five most common causes of ear pain and how to deal with them.Read Here\"),\n",

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Ear Pain', 'section': 'Diagnosis'}, page_content=\"If you experience any symptoms of ear pain such as burning pain or discomfort, hearing loss, or drainage from the ear, then it is wise to consult a doctor. Your doctor might do some physical examination followed by a few questions related to your daily routine to know the cause of it. Diagnosing ear pain often only requires a medical history and physical examination by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. 1. Medical historyAn ENT specialist can ask several questions related to the details of your pain like what the pain feels like, does the pain come and go, and whether a person is experiencing symptoms such as fever, hearing loss, and balance problems, ear drainage or tinnitus (ringing in the ears). 2. Physical examinationDuring your physical exam, the general physician will inspect the ear and parts of the ear including the outer, middle, and inner ear, ear canal, and tympanic membrane (eardrum) with an otoscope (an instrument designed for visual examination of the eardrum and the passage of the outer ear, typically having a light and a set of lenses). The most common causes are temporomandibular joint syndrome, pharyngitis (sore throat), dental disease, and cervical spine arthritis. The doctor will also look for the medical history of asthma, respiratory illness, and sinusitis in both children and adults. In some cases, nasal endoscopy is recommended. It is a non-surgical procedure that allows for the examination of the middle ear, nasal passages, and openings to the sinuses and/or the upper section of the gastrointestinal tract. 3. Blood testsThese may be used to help diagnose various ear pain conditions in case of an ear infection. White blood cell (WBC) count: This test can help to determine an infection or inflammation as WBCs play a vital role in your immune system. They assist in fighting infection and help in defense against other foreign materials. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): C- reactive protein (CRP): It is a marker for inflammation, and its level increase during bacterial infection and tissue damage. These blood tests are not precisely done for detecting ear pain, but the evaluation can help rule out other related diseases like thyroid disorders and syphilis, all of which may have symptoms similar to those of Meniere's disease. 4. ImagingIf the diagnosis is not clear from the history and physical examination, imaging studies are done for a precise outcome. Imaging is sometimes needed to sort out an ear pain diagnosis. X-ray: It is done to evaluate the jaws and adjacent areas of the ear. Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): It can be done for visualizing the middle and inner ear. The MRI scan is generally advised by the doctor when he finds that your hearing loss is sensorineural which means there is a problem with the nerves, to suspect a possible tumor such as nasopharyngeal cancer as the source of your ear pain. 5. Hearing testsThese may be recommended if there have been recurrent infections or if there has been a delay in speech development in children. 6. TympanometryIt refers to a test that helps in the evaluation of the proper functioning of the middle ear. The middle ear is positioned behind the eardrum, also known as the tympanic membrane.\\u200c The test seeks to establish the condition and movement of the tympanic membrane as it responds to changes in pressure. The test helps doctors to identify and monitor any problems with the middle ear. After the test, the doctor records the results in a graph called a tympanogram. Tympanometry is helpful in the diagnosis of ear problems that can lead to hearing loss, mostly in children.

The treatment of choice will specifically depend on the root cause of your ear pain. 1. Self-care planHome therapies can sometimes go a long way in easing ear pain, especially if the pain is related to fluid build-up from a virus or allergies. Hold a warm compress against your ear or sinuses. Performing simple jaw exercises in case of temporomandibular disorder (TMD). For a blocked eustachian tube, drugs commonly used include decongestants and antihistamines can be used. If a buildup of wax is causing your ear pain, you may be given wax-softening ear drops. They may cause the wax to fall out on its own. In case of children, antibiotics cannot be prescribed immediately, watchful waiting and delayed prescribing steps are what doctors recommend. Watchful waiting for the child and waiting to check if the child needs antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. 2. Ear flushing This procedure is done to remove impacted wax, debris, infected material, and dead skin cells in the treatment of otitis externa (external ear). If a buildup of wax is causing your ear pain, you may be given wax-softening ear drops, this causes the wax to soften. Ear lavage also known as ear irrigation or ear flush, is a safe method of earwax removal. 3. Medication Antibiotics are often not needed for middle ear infections because the bodyΓÇÖs immune system can fight off the infection on its own. However, sometimes antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, are needed to treat severe cases right away or cases that last longer than 2ΓÇô3 days. A standard 10-day course is recommended for younger children and children with severe illness; whereas a 5 to 7 day course is appropriate for children 6 and older with mild to moderate illness. To soothe ear pain, sometimes the doctor may recommend over-the-counter acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such ibuprofen. This medication can help in getting relief in pain and fever. For the pain of TMJ syndrome, your general practitioner may also prescribe a muscle relaxant or a tricyclic antidepressant. Ear drops work in combination to reduce inflammation, treat the infection, and ease the pain. The drops contain active ingredients like acetic acid, benzocaine, benzocaine + chlorbutol + paradichlorobenzene + turpentine oil, and paradichlorobenzene + benzocaine + chlorbutol. 4. SurgeryIn a few cases, a surgical procedure called a myringotomy is sometimes needed to treat chronic middle ear infections which causes persistent ear pain in children and adults. The term myringotomy is a surgery where a tiny incision is made on the eardrum to drain out any fluid or pus that may have accumulated in the middle ear. Sometimes, an ear tube insertion is also placed, known as tympanostomy tubes or grommets, into the eardrum to reduce the occurrence of ear infections and allow drainage of excess fluids. The procedure is very common and poses minimal risks. An ear tube insertion is more common for children, who tend to suffer ear infections more often than adults. Surgery may also be indicated for other ear pain diagnoses like a tumor, severe mastoiditis, or abscess formation in perichondritis.'),\n",

When you are sexually stimulated, there is a release of neurotransmitters namely nitric oxide (NO) from the nerve terminals in the penis. This causes relaxation of the smooth muscles of blood vessels and results in increased blood flow into the cavernosa of the penile region. This causes the penis to become erect and rigid. Erection ends when the ejaculation occurs and sexual arousal ends, that allows the accumulated cavernosa blood to flow out through the penile veins back into the circulation.

While lifestyle changes and oral medications are typically first-line treatments for ED, more-invasive treatments including intracavernosal injections and surgically implanted prosthetic devices may be required for the management of complex cases. 1. Oral medications These medications inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which keeps the level of cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) high and promotes erections. The most well-known of these PDE5 inhibitors is sildenafil, while other commonly used medications include: Tadalafil Vardenafil Avanafil2. Intracavernosal injections (ICIs)These are an alternative to oral medications and are injected directly into the penile corpora (at the lateral base of the penis).

Regular workout helps to keep lifestyle problems such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, high cholesterol, and stress away which also decreases the risk for erectile dysfunction. 2. Foods to eat and avoid A healthy, balanced diet plays a very integral role in maintaining the flow of blood to the sexual organs such as the pelvis and penis. Nutritious and healthy eating habits reduce an individualΓÇÖs risk for lifestyle problems such as obesity, vascular diseases, and diabetes. Include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your daily diet. Reduce or avoid the intake of foods such as red meat and refined grains as it may increase the risk for erectile dysfunction. 3.

The vascular network that produces an erection is often controlled by the nervous system. These medications have been found to interfere with the critical nerve signals and therefore impair the sexual response. 4.

The contraction in the blood vessels inhibits the supply of blood to the pelvic region and helps adversely affect sexual health. 5. Get rid of your vices Drink in moderation. Excess of alcohol has been found to be detrimental to the overall health. Chronic heavy drinking has been found to affect organ systems, causing fluctuations in the sex hormones. Irregular fluctuations in the sex hormones have been found to affect the sexual health and are considered to be major triggers for conditions such as erectile dysfunction. If you smoke, quit smoking.

Stabbing pain that can be intermittent. Systemic symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes in the affected area may occur. 2. Infectious Rash (Acute Stage) Timeframe: 7-10 days after the prodrome. Symptoms: A red rash typically appears as a band or strip on one side of the body, often on the trunk, face, or neck. The rash turns into fluid-filled blisters, which then burst and crust over in 1-2 weeks. The rash is usually painful and may be accompanied by itching or a burning sensation. 3.

However, if it happens frequently, is left unattended, and becomes chronic, it can lead to: 1.Peptic ulcers: Gastritis can lead to the development of open sores on the stomach lining or the upper part of the small intestine, known as peptic ulcers. 2. Atrophic gastritis: Chronic gastritis, including H. pylori gastritis and autoimmune gastritis, can progress to atrophic gastritis. In this condition, ongoing inflammation leads to the destruction of stomach glands responsible for producing acid and enzymes. 3. Iron-deficiency anemia: Chronic bleeding from the stomach due to gastritis can cause iron deficiency anemia, where there is a decrease in red blood cells or haemoglobin due to inadequate iron levels. 4.Vitamin B12 deficiency: Autoimmune gastritis, a type of gastritis, can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency as the immune system mistakenly attacks cells that produce intrinsic factors, a protein required for vitamin B12 absorption. 5. Deficiency of other vitamins and minerals: Atrophic autoimmune gastritis can lead to deficiencies in vitamins C, D, and folic acid, as well as minerals like zinc, magnesium, and calcium. 6. Gastric bleeding: Severe inflammation and erosions in the stomach lining can result in gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to the presence of blood in vomit or dark stools. 7.Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Gastritis can contribute to the development of GERD, a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms. 8. Gastric polyps: These are small masses of cells that form on the lining of the stomach. Does gastritis increase the risk of stomach cancer? Yes, long-term, untreated gastritis, particularly caused by H. pylori infection, can increase the risk of developing stomach (gastric) cancer.

These degenerative changes occur in various joints making them stiff. Degeneration of the joints also leads to formation of osteophytes which are extra bony protrusions and are characteristic to osteoarthritic joints. These can lead to immense pain and stiffness. In advanced stages, joint deformities occur that can severely impact function and mobility. HeredityGenetic factors likely influence the formation of osteophytes and degeneration of joints. This is likely attributed to polymorphism in genes regulating the inflammatory pathways. For example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by joint hypermobility, can contribute to osteoarthritis. Environmental factorsA poor posture, lack of exercise, obesity, occupational hazards, such as lifting heavy weights, previous trauma to the joints cause faster wear and tear of the joints, leading to osteoarthritis.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Osteoarthritis', 'section': 'Treatment'}, page_content='The treatment of osteoarthritis mainly involves medical management & surgical management. Medical Management 1. NSAID Analgesics : These include medicines like Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, and Paracetamol that help relieve pain and inflammation. These medicines must always be consumed with meals as taking them on an empty stomach can irritate the gastric lining. 2.Narcotics: This class of drugs may be required for more severe intensity pain, which is not relieved by the first line of medications. These tablets must be used only as prescribed by the physician as they are potentially habit-forming. In 2010, the government (FDA) approved the use of duloxetine (Cymbalta) for chronic (long-term) musculoskeletal pain including from OA. This oral drug is not new. It also is in use for other health concerns, such as mood disorders, nerve pain and fibromyalgia. 3. Muscle relaxants: These drugs help relieve the painful spasms and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis of the spine. One of the most commonly used drugs in this category is Cyclobenzaprine. 4. Corticosteroids: This class includes medicine like Prednisolone which may be prescribed for a short duration or even as an injection to help resist pain. Joint injections with corticosteroids (sometimes called cortisone shots) or with a form of lubricant called hyaluronic acid can give months of pain relief from OA. This lubricant is given in the knee, and these shots may help delay the need for a knee replacement by a few years in some patients. 5. Topical analgesics & sprays: Topical application of analgesic ointments and sprays can help with symptomatic pain relief. 6. Medications for nerve pain: These are useful in providing relief from complications of osteoarthritis of the spine, such as radiating pain, tingling, numbness in the upper and lower limbs. 7. Supplements: Many over-the-counter nutrition supplements have been used for osteoarthritis treatment. Most lack good research data to support their effectiveness and safety. Among the most widely used are calcium, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. Fish oils are also known to have anti- inflammatory properties. However, their use has been established mainly in rheumatoid arthritis. To ensure safety and avoid drug interactions, consult your doctor or pharmacist before using any of these supplements Surgical Management and Other Invasive Procedures Intra-articular Injections In cases of severe pain that does not respond to medications, a Hydrocortisone injection may be given in the joint to offer quick relief. Hyaluronic Acid Injections are given in the joint to help with joint lubrication. Alignment correction surgery Corrective surgeries like osteotomy, laminectomy, spinal fusion are performed in severe joint deformities that cause limitation of function and pain. Joint Replacement Surgery: For severely damaged knees and hips, a prosthesis may be fitted, and the worn-out joints are completely replaced by mechanical joints. Though some of the joint changes are irreversible, most patients will not need joint replacement surgery. At present, there is no treatment that can reverse the damage of OA in the joints. However, research is going on to find ways to slow or reverse this joint damage. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): This uses a low-voltage electrical current to relieve pain.

It is also present in the products derived from milk such as cheese and yogurt. Breast milk and cowΓÇÖs milk contain approximately 7.2 g of lactose per 100 ml and cowΓÇÖs milk contains about 5g of lactose per 100 ml respectively. During infancy, it provides a very good source of energy that helps in overall growth and development. Interesting fact! Lactose is the only sugar that does not increase the risk of dental caries. How does the lactose digested and absorbed in the body?The enzyme lactase present in the small intestine plays a very key role in the digestion of lactose.Lactose contains two types of sugar molecules i.e. glucose and galactose. In the small intestine, lactose is broken down into these two simple sugars. The glucose is absorbed in the body and used as an energy source. How does lactose intolerance take place?The main cause of lactose intolerance is the deficiency or the inactivity of the lactase enzyme. What happens if Lactose is not digested? Accumulation of lactose in the large intestine Bacteria present in the large intestine ferments lactose and produce gasses including hydrogen (H2 ), carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These gases affect the GI function and manifest as the symptoms mentioned above. What is the difference between lactose intolerance and cowΓÇÖs milk allergy?**CowΓÇÖs milk allergy is a type of immune mediated reaction unlike lactose intolerance which occurs primarily due to the deficiency in lactase enzyme. The symptoms of lactose intolerance start to appear at 5-6 years of age in contrast to milk allergy which peaks during the first year of life.

Race: Asians, Americans, Hispanics, are more prone to lactose intolerance. Genes: Genes may also predetermine the production of lactase enzymes as well as gut microbiome, predisposing some to lactose intolerance. However, it is rare that someone is born with a lactase deficiency. Premature birth: The premature babies have a high risk of lactose intolerance due to inability of the underdeveloped intestine to digest lactose. Composition of gut microbiota: Certain bacteria present in the intestine ferment the lactose. The fermented products produce gas that increases the chances of developing symptoms of lactose intolerance. Listen to our expert about tips to improve gut health.Watch Now Amount of lactose consumed: The severity of symptoms can be increased as the amount of lactose consumed is increased. Food accompanying dairy products: The chances of developing symptoms are also increased if the lactose containing food items are taken alongwith the high protein and fatty food such as meat and fish. These foods stay longer in the large intestine and trigger the symptoms. Gastrointestinal diseases: Some diseases may affect the brush border cells of the intestine. This can lead to the damage of lactase enzymes which can eventually cause lactose intolerance.

The understanding of clinical history also helps in revealing the association between the ingestion of lactose and occurrence of symptoms.Medical history is followed by physical examination in which signs of abdominal pain, tenderness, and bloating are evaluated. The commonly used tests for the diagnosis of lactose intolerance include: 1. Lactose breath test (hydrogen breath test)This test is most commonly used for the diagnosis of lactose intolerance. It involves breathing into a balloon-type container every 30 minutes over a few hours, to measure the amount of hydrogen in the breath. High amount of hydrogen gas indicates the presence of undigested lactose, a marker of lactose intolerance.However, certain factors can affect the test result by altering the intestinal bacteria flora: Use of some specific medications oral antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and aspirin Abuse of laxatives (stool softeners) Invasive procedures that require bowel cleansing with enemas Use of probiotics before the test Consumption of some foods such as beans, corn, white wheat, potatoes, and oats 2. Lactose tolerance testThis test measures the amount of glucose at regular intervals after consuming 50 gm lactose containing liquid. Readings are taken at 0, 60, and 120 minutes. The failure of the blood glucose levels to rise by 20g may indicate lactose intolerance. The test has good sensitivity except in some conditions such as diabetes and small bacterial overgrowth. However, the test is useful in instances where there is absence of bacteria that does not produce hydrogen and hydrogen breath test can not be utilized. Note: The measurement of breath hydrogen after ingestion of 25 to 50 g of lactose is more sensitive and specific than the lactose intolerance test. 3. Milk tolerance testNormally, lactose is digested and absorbed as glucose. Lactose intolerance is characterized by malabsorption of glucose. In this test, 500 ml of milk is given to the individual followed by testing of blood sugar. A rise in blood sugar of less than 9 mg/dl indicates lactose intolerance. 4. Stool acidity testThis test measures the pH of stool. Lactose intolerance is characterized by decrease in the pH of the stool. 5. Bowel biopsy**In this, a small portion of the small intestine is removed for examination. Any damage in the cells of the small intestine that produce lactase enzyme is checked.

RadiotherapyRadiation therapy uses X-rays to destroy or damage cancer cells, making them unable to proliferate. Radiotherapy is mainly used in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. It uses: External beam radiation therapy: This uses external radiation therapy sources that emit X-rays, gamma rays, electrons or heavy particles. Brachytherapy: It is a type of internal radiation therapy in which seeds, ribbons, or capsules that contain a radiation source are placed inside the body, or near the tumors. 4. Targeted therapy This is very successful in many types of cancer, though, to date, all other targeted drugs have failed in pancreatic cancer patients. Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab as a targeted treatment for pancreatic cancer. 5. Latest treatment protocols* Gene therapy: Gene therapy delivers specific genes to cancer cells, which are often carried by specially designed viruses. Cancer stem cells: Research currently focuses on identifying treatments that may specifically target pancreatic cancer stem cells. Genetic/molecular studies: Many new research developments are based on identifying damaged genes and proteins and repairing or changing how they work. Circulating tumor (ct)DNA: ctDNA is studied to monitor treatment response, detect early disease recurrence, and identify resistance to treatment. 6. Other treatment modalities Percutaneous bile duct drainage: A procedure to drain bile to relieve pressure in the bile ducts caused by a blockage. Surgical gastrojejunostomy: A surgical procedure in which an anastomosis is created between the stomach and the proximal loop of the jejunum.

Bacterial meningitisThis type of meningitis is caused by bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group B Streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which generally causes tuberculosis or TB, is a less common cause of bacterial meningitis (called TB meningitis). Bacteria can enter a personΓÇÖs meninges in various ways as follows: Via the bloodstream Ear, throat or sinus infections Defect in the dura mater (dense outer layer of meninges) Skull fracture Neurosurgical proceduresThe spread of bacterial meningitis generally depends on the type of bacteria that causes it. Bacterial meningitis can spread from person to person and also via certain foods such as unpasteurized dairy or deli meats. A person can be a carrier for bacterial meningitis and pass it on to others without getting sick themselves. Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition and requires medical attention right away. It can be life threatening or cause permanent disabilities, such as brain damage, hearing loss, and learning disabilities, in case the treatment is delayed. 2. Viral meningitisMeningitis caused by a virus is called viral meningitis and it is the most common type. Non-polio enteroviruses are the most common cause of viral meningitis however, other viruses that cause this disease are mumps virus, herpes viruses (Epstein-barr virus, herpes simplex viruses, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus), measles virus, influenza virus, arboviruses (west nile virus and zika virus), and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Most people get better on their own without treatment however infants and people with a weakened immune system are more likely to get a severe form of illness. 3. Fungal meningitisIt spreads from fungal infections at any other part of the body that goes and infects the brain and spinal cord. Some causes of fungal meningitis are Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Candida, and Mucormycosis. It is most likely to affect immunocompromised individuals such as HIV patients, cancer patients or transplant recipients. 4. Parasitic meningitisVarious parasites can affect the brain or nervous system in many ways and cause meningitis. Overall, parasitic meningitis is much less common than viral and bacterial meningitis. Some parasites can cause a rare form of meningitis called eosinophilic meningitis, eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, or EM. The three main parasites that can cause EM are Angiostrongylus cantonensis (neurologic angiostrongyliasis), Baylisascaris procyonis (baylisascariasis and neural larva migrans), and Gnathostoma spinigerum (neurognathostomiasis). 5. Amebic meningitisPrimary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by Naegleria fowleri and is a rare brain infection that is usually fatal. Naegleria fowleri is a free-living ameba (a single-celled living organism that is too small to be seen without a microscope). Naegleria fowleri is found in soil and warm freshwater around the world. It grows best at higher temperatures up to 115┬░F (46┬░C) and can survive for short periods at higher temperatures. 6.

Meningitis can be confirmed by one or more of the following diagnostic tests: 1. Blood testsInitial blood tests in the case of meningitis suspicion should include: Complete blood count (CBC) Coagulation studies Electrolytes Blood cultures 2. Lumbar punctureA lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is done to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and definitively diagnose meningitis. In people with meningitis, the CSF often shows a low sugar level along with an elevated white blood cell count and protein. 3. CSF analysisCSF fluid should also be sent for gram staining, standard culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CSF analysis helps to pinpoint which bacteria caused meningitis. PCR testing is more advantageous than culture for the diagnosis of infection as this technique is more rapid and is able to detect a variety of strains of even non-viable bacteria and antibodies against certain viruses 4. Dilated fundus examinationDilated fundus examination is a diagnostic procedure that employs the use of eye drops to dilate or enlarge the pupil of the eye to obtain a better view of the fundus of the eye. The fundus can be examined to look for signs of papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve, which connects the eye and brain), a surrogate marker for raised intracranial pressure. In an immunocompetent patient with no known history of recent head trauma, normal level of consciousness and no evidence of papilledema or focal neurological deficits, it is considered safe to perform lumbar puncture (LP) without prior neuroimaging. 5. Imaging testsIf your doctor advises, imaging tests such as CT scan head can be performed before a lumbar puncture to rule out any hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure. The criteria for getting a CT scan include advanced age (greater than 60), focal neurologic deficits, immunodeficiency, new-onset seizures, altered mental status, and central nervous system disease in the past.'),\n",

Most of the people tend to ignore these signs, till it manifests as a clinical illness and can have serious and life changing health implications. Here are the most common and early signs of depression. If you or anyone in your family is experiencing these signs, you may need to consult a therapist or a psychiatrist. 1. Getting irritated very oftenMany people think that depression leads to just sadness. But some people with depression can get angry often, feel irritated over trivial issues and argue over small things. While these signs could be due to stress as well, if you notice an increased irritability in your behavior, do not ignore it. Take a moment to consider the possibility that you may be depressed. 2. Loss of interestA common sign of depression is that you have a lack of interest in otherwise pleasurable activities like your favorite hobbies, meeting friends and in sex. People tend to avoid social gatherings, become more withdrawn and lose the inclinations towards achieving simple everyday goals. 3. Changes in appetiteOne of the classical signs of depression is a dramatic change in appetite. This can reflect as eating too much or too little. If you have a weight gain or loss of more than 5% of your body weight in one month, it could be a warning sign of depression. Some people take up eating as a way to compensate for how they feel while others experience a loss of interest in food. 4. Being too pessimisticIf you find yourself criticizing and cribbing about almost everything all the time and if you tend to hold a negative or demotivating opinion on everything, it could be a sign of depression. 5. Sleep disturbancesMost of the people with depression first consult their doctor because of sleeping disturbances theyΓÇÖve experienced. While having troubled sleep for a couple of nights is a normal phenomenon, persistent sleep difficulties or insomnia can be a symptom of depression. Many people with depression struggle to fall asleep, or stay asleep, despite feeling exhausted. Other people with depression sleep too much. 6. Having aches and painsYour brain is designed in such a manner that when you are struggling with mental health issues, you tend to develop signs of physical illness too. Many people with depression experience unexplained body aches, muscle pains and headaches. But they attribute these to a physical health problem and pop painkillers instead. 7. Feeling tired all the timeDepression can make you feel fatigued and tired all the time and lower your energy levels. Most of the people attribute this to excessive workload or increasing age and do not address it in a timely manner. Remember that if small tasks tire you or take longer to complete, you may be depressed. 8. Feeling of guiltBlaming yourself without a logical reasoning for all the events in your life is an unhealthy trait. If you blame yourself responsible for all personal, professional and childhood issues, you may be depressed. Many people with depression also feel worthless. Always pay close attention to your inner thought process. If you feel you are being excessively harsh, critical or illogical, it could be a sign of depression. 9. Difficulty in concentrationMany people with depression face forgetfulness and misplace things like their keys or paperwork very frequently. People with early signs of depression experience difficulty concentrating and focusing for example when giving or receiving direction or comprehending what theyΓÇÖre reading, and an inability to remember specific details. Additional signs include: Low mood/sadness Crying spells Diminished interest in play and activities Problems with concentration Excessive tiredness/fatigue/weakness Behavior symptoms such as anger and aggression/agitation Self-accusation/self-criticism Work difficulty Expectation of punishment Decreased appetite Anorexia Decreased sleep/change in sleeping pattern Increased appetite, weight gain, and excessive sleep Past failure/sense of failure Anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities) Anxiety symptoms Irritability Hopelessness Physical symptoms/multiple complaints such as headache, abdominal pain, and chest pain Suicidal ideations/thoughts Psychotic features in the form of persecutory delusions Catatonia (inability to move normally or speak) Depersonalization Obsessive compulsive symptoms Guilt Attempted suicide Recent deterioration in school performance Dissatisfaction Self dislike Indecisiveness Social withdrawal Loss of libido Body image changes Poor interaction Decreased interest in school Low self esteem Death wishes Worthlessness Loss of energyNote:** Depressive episodes can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the impact on the individualΓÇÖs functioning.

Children as young as 5 years of age have shown signs of depression and it need not always be a reaction to a major environmental stressor. Children often show more behavioral symptoms (such as crying, irritability and tantrums) or physical symptoms (such as nausea, lack of appetite, stomach ache and headache), instead of saying that they are feeling sad or have negative thoughts.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Depression', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content='The exact cause of depression is not yet known. Depression can occur spontaneously, without any obvious reason. Some experts think it could be due to imbalance in the brain chemicals, while some believe it could be due to a genetic defect. Some believe that a personΓÇÖs environment and emotions play a crucial role in developing depression. Hence, depression can be defined in ΓÇÿbio-psycho-socialΓÇÖ terms, meaning that it is a complex disorder most likely triggered by overlapping biological, psychological, and environmental factors. What happens in the brain? Our brain is made up of millions of nerve cells, also known as neurons. These cells are responsible for relaying chemical signals back and forth from the brain to various parts of the body. The neurons interact with each other via chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters (in simple terms brain chemicals). These messages help the brain to have thoughts, emotions and sensations, which play a key role in your brain function and mental wellbeing. What happens during depression? In depression, it is believed that there is an imbalance in the brain chemicals. There is either too much or too little of these neurotransmitters, which affect your ability to think, feel and emote. These neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Medications to manage depression often focus on altering the levels of these chemicals in the brain. In some people with depression, brain scans show a smaller hippocampus, which plays a major role in long-term memory. Exposure to stress and other risk factors can impair the growth of nerve cells in the hippocampus and trigger depression.'),\n",

However, there are many potential factors that can trigger or influence depression: 1. Family history and genetics Genetic makeup and heredity are thought to be significant factors that influence depression. Some types of depression run in families, especially bipolar disorder. While studies suggest that there is a strong genetic component that increases the risk of getting depression, other factors are usually needed to trigger the symptoms. 2. Psychological and social factors History of physical, emotional or sexual abuse Social isolation or loneliness Low socioeconomic status Stressful life events like loss of a loved one, divorce, loss of a job & financial issues Sometimes, even positive events like marriage, shifting places, graduation, or retirement can also cause depression as they alter the daily routine which can trigger feelings 3. Medical conditions Physical health and certain medical conditions like ongoing or chronic physical pain or disease, sleep disorder, thyroid disorder, diabetes, liver disease, multiple sclerosis, Addison\\'s disease, ParkinsonΓÇÖs disease, and cancer can cause symptoms of depression. 4. InflammationInflammation caused by diseases or stress may cause chemical changes in the brain that can trigger or worsen depression in certain people. It can also affect response to drug therapy. 5. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) TBIs or concussions following any injury to the head from falls, accidents, and workplace and sports-related injuries are thought to trigger depression. 6. Certain medications Some medications that treat hypertension (high blood pressure), cancer, and seizures can cause depression. Even some psychiatric medicines such as certain sleeping aids and medications used to treat alcoholism and anxiety, can trigger depression. 7. Personality People who are easily overwhelmed, have trouble coping with stress or anxiety, have low self-esteem or who are generally pessimistic or self critical are more prone to depression. 8. History of other mental health conditions Anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders and learning disabilities are commonly associated with or can perpetuate depression. 9. Lifestyle factors Recreational drugs and alcohol can also cause depression or make it worse. Working late till night and getting up late or spending less time outdoors can disrupt the circadian rhythm which may trigger depression. Along with disruption in circadian rhythm, reduced sunlight can also lead to a drop in serotonin and melatonin levels in the body, which can disrupt mood and sound sleep. 10. Poor diet A poor or imbalanced diet with deficiency of vital vitamins and minerals are known to cause depression. Low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin D and an imbalanced ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids are associated with increased rates of depression. Also, high levels of sugar intake are thought to trigger depression. Why are women at a higher risk than men?According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the burden of depression is 50% higher for females than males. Depression is widely prevalent in women in India across all age groups. Psychosocial and social factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of women to depression include: Stress Victimization Sex-specific socialization Coping style Disadvantaged social status Perceived stigma of mental illness Domestic violenceWomen have the greatest risk for developing depressive disorders during their child-bearing years. This could be attributed to the hormone changes associated with menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and giving birth. The following types of depression can occur in females: 1. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of premenstrual disorder which affects women in the days or weeks before having their menstrual periods. 2. Antenatal depression: It is also known as prenatal or perinatal depression. It affects women during pregnancy, and can lead to postpartum depression if not treated timely or properly. 3. Postpartum psychiatric disorders: They can be divided into three categories: postpartum blues, postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. Postpartum bluesPostpartum blues or so-called \"baby blues\" happen in many women in the days right after delivery. The mother can get overwhelmed and have sudden mood swings. She may feel impatient, irritable, restless, lonely, sad or may cry without any reason. Postpartum blues do not always require any treatment and may resolve in a few days to a week. Love and reassurance, support from the family in sharing childcare duties, and talking to other new mothers can be of great help. Postpartum depressionPostpartum depression can start soon after childbirth or as a continuation of antenatal depression and needs to be treated.The global prevalence of postpartum depression has been estimated as 100ΓÇÆ150 per 1000 births. A woman can have similar but stronger feelings as experienced in the baby blues. Symptoms of postpartum depression often can get worse and last for as long as one year. Postpartum depression can predispose to chronic or recurrent depression, which may affect the mother-infant relationship and child growth and development. Children of mothers with postpartum depression have greater cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal problems compared with the children of non-depressed mothers. Hence, timely treatment with medication and counseling is very important Postpartum psychosisPostpartum psychosis, which has a global prevalence ranging from 0.89 to 2.6 per 1000 births, is a severe disorder that begins postpartum. New mothers suffering from postpartum psychosis may feel agitated, angry and show strange behavior.

The treatment of depression involves both pharmacological (medical) and psychological approaches. 1. Medical therapyThe drugs used to treat depression are known as antidepressants. These drugs may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use yet full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations, other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects. Also, the possible reasons for no improvement in the symptoms post treatment include: Not taking the antidepressants for the recommended period because ideally, antidepressants might take 8 to 12 weeks to show any effect. Not taking the medications regularly. Taking the medicines in low doses (under dosing). Always discuss with your doctor prior to making any dose changes. Concurrent substance abuse which might contribute to the non responsiveness of depressive symptoms. Some underlying medical disorder which has been unaddressed.Antidepressants can be classified into typical antidepressants and atypical antidepressants. A) Typical antidepressants These are further divided into: 1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) SSRIs are used as frontline drugs for the treatment of depression and anxiety. These drugs increase the level of serotonin and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Examples of this class of drugs include: Escitalopram Fluoxetine Sertraline Paroxetine2. Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) As the name suggests, SNRIs are the drugs that aid in the treatment of depression by increasing the level of serotonin and noradrenaline in the body. The list of drugs that fall under this category include: Duloxetine Milnacipran Venlafaxine3. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors This type of antidepressant primarily increases the level of noradrenaline, thereby improving the symptoms of depression. However, these drugs also increase the level of serotonin in the body. Some of the commonly prescribed MAO inhibitors include: Phenelzine Isocarboxazid Tranylcypromine4. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) This class of antidepressants work by increasing levels of the hormone noradrenaline in the body. These are outdated medications (not used currently). Examples of these drugs include: Nortriptyline Amitriptyline ImipramineNote: Selegiline, a newer MAOI that sticks on the skin as a patch, may cause fewer side effects than other MAOIs do. B) Atypical antidepressants As this class of drugs do not have a specific action mechanism they are known as atypical antidepressants. Some of the common examples of these medications are: Mirtazapine Agomelatine Bupropion AtomoxetineHere are 8 things about antidepressants everyone needs to know. Read To Know! 2. PsychotherapyAlso known as talk therapy or psychological therapy, it is a common approach used for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues in the form of counseling sessions with a mental health professional. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This type of psychological therapy helps teach the patient coping skills to manage their difficult conditions. The therapy focuses on the cognitive component. This helps the patient to change their thinking about a particular situation and the behavioral component which further helps them to change their reactions to any situation. Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This is a time-limited approach that focuses on improving the symptoms of depression and treating mood disorders. In this, a therapist emphatically engages the patient to improve their communication with others and solve the problem. 3. Surgical and other interventions Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT): Also known as shock therapy, this mode of treatment is the best for acute depression. It is also useful for patients who do not respond to drug therapy, are psychotic, or are suicidal or dangerous to themselves. Onset of action may be more rapid than that of drug treatments, with benefit often seen within 1 week of commencing treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): It is usually reserved for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. During TMS, a treatment coil placed against your scalp, it sends brief magnetic pulses to stimulate nerve cells in your brain that are involved in mood regulation and depression. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): This approach is also used in refractory cases. Like ECT, it uses electrical stimulation to relieve the symptoms of depression. The difference is that the device is surgically implanted in your body. VNS is FDA-approved for the long-term (not acute) depression of chronic depression that does not respond to at least two antidepressant trials. Its effects may take up to 9 months to appear and studies have shown that a meaningful response seems to occur only in about 1 in 3 people.\"),\n",

The more time zones crossed, the greater the disruption to the body's circadian rhythm and the more severe the jet lag. Travel duration: The longer the travel duration, the greater the risk of jet lag, as prolonged flights across several time zones. The direction of travel: Traveling eastward, where you lose hours and move ahead in time, tends to result in more pronounced jet lag than westward travel. Frequency of travel: Individuals who travel frequently and for longer periods of time are at a higher risk. Altered light exposure: Traveling to a new time zone often results in changes in the timing and intensity of exposure to natural light, which can confuse the body's internal clock. Note: Changes in cabin pressure and high altitudes during air travel can also aggravate the symptoms of jet lag. 2. Individual factors Age: Young children and older adults may be more vulnerable to jet lag. Individual sensitivity: Some individuals are more sensitive to time zone changes due to genetic factors and individual variability in circadian rhythm regulation.

Watch this Video Caffeine and alcohol Intake: Excessive consumption of these just before the flight can disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to jet lag symptoms. Dehydration: Air travel can lead to dehydration due to the low humidity. This can lead to fatigue and discomfort associated with jet lag. Meal timings: Irregular meal timings during travel, especially across different time zones can contribute to jet lag. Irregular work schedule: People who work irregular or rotating shifts may already have disrupted circadian rhythms, making them more susceptible to jet lag.

While it may not be possible to completely eliminate jet lag, these tips can help alleviate its symptoms and make the transition to a new time zone smoother: 1. Before travelYou can start adjusting your sleep schedule ahead of time to align with the time zone at your destination. Here are a few tips to help you adapt to the time change more easily: When traveling west, it is advised to delay bedtime by an hour or two, and when traveling east, it is recommended to go to bed an hour or two earlier. Plan travel arrangements so that you arrive at your destination a minimum of 2 days before any significant commitments, allowing your body sufficient time to get adjusted. Stomach discomfort and other digestive issues can occur as a result of jet lag. Therefore, having smaller & lighter meals before traveling might alleviate these symptoms. Opt for daylight arrival flights to boost alertness upon landing and enhance adaptation to the new time zone. 2. During TravelOn the flight, there are several strategies you can use to minimize the effects of jet lag and arrive at your destination feeling more refreshed. Here are some tips: Planes have low humidity levels, which can cause dehydration. Make sure to drink sufficient water throughout the flight. Avoid alcohol and caffeine during flight as it can contribute to dehydration and disrupt your sleep patterns. Wear clothes that are not tight. Use noise-canceling headphones, white noise, eye masks, earplugs, and comfortable travel pillows and blankets for better sleep during travel. When it is possible, move around in the cabin. If it's daytime at your destination, try to stay awake and expose yourself to natural light. If it's nighttime, consider sleeping to align with the local time. If you're crossing multiple time zones, consider the direction of travel when choosing your seat. If you're traveling eastward, a seat on the east side of the plane may expose you to morning light, helping you adjust. 3. After TravelAdjusting to a new time zone after a flight is crucial for preventing or minimizing jet lag. Here are some tips for post-flight to help you adapt more quickly: Spend time outdoors in natural daylight at your destination as it helps reset your internal clock. Take a shower to feel refreshed. It will also assist in overcoming jet lag by improving circulation and energy levels while adjusting to a different time zone. While it can be tempting to take a nap upon arrival, try to resist if it's not part of your regular sleep schedule. Napping can delay the adjustment process. To avoid oversleeping, set alarms in the morning and make sure to switch on the lights once you wake up. Engage in light physical activity to help combat fatigue and improve your overall well-being. This can include walking, stretching, or low-intensity exercises. Try to eat lighter meals in the evening to prevent digestive discomfort and to promote better sleep. Create a calming bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This may include activities such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques.

The doctor will also check for the occupation. 2. Blood testsThe various blood tests available for the detection of leptospirosis include: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): It is a simple blood test that measures inflammation or any infection in the body. The ESR rate is elevated in the case of leptospirosis. Peripheral blood smear:A blood smear is a basic test that is used to determine abnormalities in the blood. It may be helpful in differentiating leptospirosis from other common acute febrile illnesses. Liver function tests: These are a group of tests to evaluate the functioning of the liver. In icteric leptospirosis, liver function tests (LFT) generally show a significant rise in bilirubin and other liver enzymes. Kidney function tests:It is a group of tests that may be performed together to evaluate kidney (renal) function. The kidneys are usually impaired by raised plasma creatinine in leptospirosis. 3.

Serological and other indirect methodsSerological tests are diagnostic methods that are used to identify antibodies and antigens in a patient's sample. They include: Microscopic agglutination test (MAT): MAT has been widely used as the reference test for antibody detection in leptospirosis. However, this tests would not be useful at the early stages of the disease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): ELISA is a modern molecular technique for the detection of antigen-antibody interaction. Many studies have demonstrated ELISA to be more sensitive than MAT for the detection of cases early in acute illness. Indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA): IHA was shown to detect both IgM and IgG classes of antibodies produced in defense to fight against leptospira.

In simple terms, it is a condition where people obsess about their weight and diet. Anorexic people often initially begin dieting to manage their weight. But over time, the restrictions in their calorie intake and diet become a psychological obsession, leading them to the point of starvation and extreme weight loss. The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are not understood. However, several factors are believed to contribute to anorexia. These include environmental stress, external compulsion, prenatal and perinatal complications, physiological factors, neurochemical changes, hormonal changes, and genetic or hereditary factors. Anorexia nervosa, if left untreated, may cause dangerous health conditions including fatigue, low blood pressure, water-electrolyte imbalance, and may even have fatal consequences, among others.

But it is believed to be caused by multifactorial biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Some of the causing factors that increase a personΓÇÖs risk of developing anorexia nervosa are as follows: 1. Psychological factorsAnorexia nervosa, an overwhelming phobia of being a normal weight, is often believed to be associated with personality and behavioral traits. In most cases, anorexic people tend to seek perfection in their looks and body image. This can cause them to restrict their diet to the point of starvation to achieve unrealistic goals. Some other psychological factors that can contribute to the development of anorexia are as follows: Excessive fear and uncertainty Medical history of depression and anxiety Painful or traumatic childhood experience Reduced ability to regulate and adapt behavior as per different situations The feeling of inadequacy and loneliness Stressful life events such as accidents, loss of a loved one 2. Environmental factorsThe current culture emphasizes being unrealistically thin as a beauty standard. This external pressure and competitiveness on achieving unhealthy body goals can increase the obsession to restricting vital food intake. 3. Social media effectsSocial media pressure and high social risk environments such as sports, modeling, and acting can contribute to the development of anorexia nervosa. Persistent exposure to media that present body ideals may constitute a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and anorexia nervosa. The cultural ideal for body shape for men versus women continues to favor slender women and athletic, V-shaped muscular men. A 2002 review found that, of the magazines most popular among people aged 18 to 24 years, those read by men, unlike those read by women, were more likely to feature ads and articles on shape than on diet. Body dissatisfaction and internalization of body ideals are risk factors for anorexia nervosa that threaten the health of both male and female populations. Websites that stress the importance of attainment of body ideals extol and promote anorexia nervosa through the use of religious metaphors, lifestyle descriptions, \"thinspiration\" or \"fitspiration\" (inspirational photo galleries and quotes that aim to serve as motivators for attainment of body ideals). Pro-anorexia websites reinforce internalization of body ideals and the importance of their attainment. The media portray a false view of what people truly look like. In magazines and movies and even on billboards most of the actors/models are digitally altered in multiple ways. People then strive to look like these \"perfect\" role models when in reality they are not near perfection themselves 4. Biological factorsThe correlation between biological factors and anorexia is not clearly understood. However, a family history of anorexia, drug abuse, and co-existing health illness increases the risk of developing anoxia. Abnormalities in the structure or function of the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, can alter eating behaviors. 5. Genetic factorsGenetic or inherited predisposition, although the mechanism to extract responsible genes associated with anorexia is not well understood, research is being conducted to increase the understanding of the role of genes in anorexia. Anorexia nervosa is highly heritable. Twin studies have shown a heritability rate of between 28 and 58%. First-degree relatives of those with anorexia have roughly 12 times the risk of developing anorexia. A 2019 study found a genetic relationship with mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, obsessiveΓÇôcompulsive disorder, anxiety disorder and depression; and metabolic functioning with a negative correlation with fat mass, type 2 diabetes and leptin. One gene that has been linked to anorexia might be of particular interest. This gene codes for a protein called the estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha). In some tissues, this gene alters the ability of estrogen and estrogen receptors to interact with DNA and change the function of cells.Since estrogen has potent effects upon appetite and feeding, any genetic abnormality in the estrogen signaling pathway could contribute to the symptoms of anorexia and explain why anorexia typically appears in young women just after the onset of puberty'),\n",

Anorexia nervosa can occur in both men and women but more in women, as they are more likely to develop negative body perceptions. Anorexia nervosa is a complex psychological disorder. Like many other eating disorders, several risk factors such as biological, sociocultural issues, psychological triggers can increase the risk of developing it. Some of the most common risk factors associated with anorexia nervosa are listed below: Having a family history of an eating disorder. Diabulimia, an eating disorder in a person with diabetes, wherein the diabetic individual purposefully restricts insulin therapy to lose weight. Extreme dieting and starvation can change the thinking pattern of vulnerable individuals and make them perpetuate their restrictive eating behaviors. Loneliness and boredom can bring psychological stress and increase the risk of developing anorexia nervosa.Age is also a factor.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment for anorexia reduce the risks associated with its own. Based on the severity and duration of your condition, your doctor might do some physical exams and a medical history analysis to rule out other mimicking health conditions. If the signs and symptoms are unclear, your physician may recommend one or a few tests to diagnose your condition. 1. Physical examinationPhysical examination for anorexia nervosa may include: Evaluation of your physical appearances, such as dry skin, sunken eyes, and growth of smooth hair over the body Calculation of your body mass index (less than 17.5 in adults, or less than 85% of expected weight in children) Checking your vitals such as cardiac heart rate, blood pressure, the temperature of your body, and other signs of malnutrition in your body Examination of your abdomen for stretch marks and liver palpation 2. Psychological evaluationPsychological evaluation for anorexia may include: Behavioral pattern change analyses such as substance abuse, self-harming, or suicidal attempts. Analysis of your family or medical history of other psychological disorders. Evaluation of your attitudes toward eating, appearance, and exercise. DSM-5 guidelinesAnorexia nervosa is classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders in the latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). There is no specific BMI cut-off that defines low weight required for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (all of which needing to be met for diagnosis) are: Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a low body weight. (Criterion A) Intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors that interfere with gaining weight. (Criterion B) Disturbance in the way a person's weight or body shape is experienced or a lack of recognition about the risks of low body weight. (Criterion C)Relative to the previous version of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR), the 2013 revision (DSM5) reflects changes in the criteria for anorexia nervosa. Most notably, the amenorrhea (absent period) criterion was removed. Amenorrhea was removed for several reasons: it does not apply to males, it is not applicable for females before or after the age of menstruation or taking birth control pills, and some women who meet the other criteria for AN still report some menstrual activity Levels of severityBody mass index (BMI) is used by the DSM-5 as an indicator of the level of severity of anorexia nervosa. The DSM-5 states these as follows: Mild: BMI of greater than 17 Moderate: BMI of 16ΓÇô16.99 Severe: BMI of 15ΓÇô15.99 Extreme: BMI of less than 15 3. Laboratory testsAlthough there is no specific confirmatory test for anorexia, assessment of your blood work may provide clues to determine any underlying health illness. Some of the common lab test used to diagnose anorexia are as follow: Blood sugar test: Diabetic patients, particularly type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, have an increased risk of developing anorexia. Electrolyte level test: It is done to determine the severity and effect of anorexia on your health condition. Complete blood count (CBC): This test may help your physician to determine the underlying cause of your anorexic condition. Comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP): This test measures 14 different parameters in the blood. The result of this test provides a picture of overall body chemical balance and metabolism. Urine routine analysis: Medical evaluation of your urine sample can be used to determine a wide range of underlying disorders causing anorexia. This test also gives clues to your hydration and fluid intake levels. Electro-cardiogram studies: They are done to access your cardiac patterns and other related ailments. Liver function test: A series of tests used to assess liver function some of the tests are also used in the assessment of malnutrition, protein deficiency Luteinizing hormone (LH)response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): Tests the pituitary glands' response to GnRh, a hormone produced in the hypothalamus.

What are neurons? These are nerve cells that send messages all over the body. Neurons receive sensory input from the external world and send motor commands to our muscles after processing in the brain. There are approximately 86 billion neurons present in the human brain. There is a huge involvement of neurons in the perception of pain. Mechanism of pain Any painful stimulus such as pressure, pinch, heat, chemical, and burn activates the pain receptors (nociceptive receptors) that are widely distributed in the skin and deep tissues. These pain receptors send signals to the brainstem (bottom part of brain) via first order neurons There is a release of calcium in the brainstem which leads to the release of a chemical called glutamate The released glutamate binds to special receptors present on the second order neurons These neurons then cross over in the spinal cord and reaches to to the cerebral cortex (part of the brain that is involved in sensation of pain)Note: An inhibitory pathway is also present in the brain stem which travels down the spinal cord. This pathway has several connecting neurons that release chemicals such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) which avoid the feeling of pain. Pain cessation results in the dominance of inhibitory pathways whereas pain enhancement is the outcome of stimulatory pathway dispensing upon the painful stimuli. How does neuropathic pain originate?There are multiple theories behind neuropathic pain. Although the exact mechanism is not clear, neuropathic pain may arise due to the: Increased activity of the first-order neurons if they are partially damaged Impairment of inhibitory pathway Development of a memory of pain in the second and third-order neurons due to alterations in the central processing of pain Increase in the sensitivity of neurons Reduced the activation threshold of neuronDid you know?Popping a painkiller is one of the most common ways to treat pain at home.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Menopause', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content='Your reproductive cycle starts from puberty and ends near the age of 40-50. Various complex methods and hormones control the process. Hypothalamus is a brain structure near the pituitary gland that produces certain chemicals that release essential sex hormones called estrogen and progesterone. These hormones stimulate the release of eggs from the ovary. If the egg fails to fertilise, the thickened lining of the uterus is shed through the vagina in the form of periods. As women age, their reproductive cycle starts to slow down and eventually stops. When your body starts nearing menopause, the ovaries start producing less of a hormone called estrogen. This decline in the hormone leads to changes in the pattern of your menstrual cycle. It starts becoming irregular, or there might be changes in the flow of your period. With these hormonal changes, your body also undergoes some physical changes as it tries to adapt to the new level of hormones. The symptoms that women experience during this transitory phase or menopause are part of their bodyΓÇÖs attempt to adjust to these changes. For women undergoing natural menopause, the process occurs in three stages. PerimenopauseThis can start ten years before the onset of menopause. This is the time when your ovaries gradually begin producing less and less of the hormone estrogen. Women in their 40s generally experience menopause, but some may start experiencing it in their 30s. The period of perimenopause lasts until menopause when ovaries completely stop producing eggs. Before that, the fluctuating level of hormones causes various symptoms in women. Women undergo different hormonal fluctuations during this transitory period, hence each woman experiences perimenopause in a different manner. The increased levels of progesterone and estrogen during anovulatory cycles (absence of menstrual cycle) may lead to endometrial cancer or hyperplasia (thickening of the uterus lining), uterine polyps (growths attached to the inner wall of the uterus), and leiomyoma (also known as fibroids) in women of perimenopausal age. MenopauseMenopause is the stage when your ovaries stop producing eggs and most of its hormone estrogen. It is diagnosed when a woman has gone 12 months without any occurrence of periods. The conditions that can cause premature menopause include: Primary ovarian insufficiency: Premature menopause may result from the failure of ovaries to produce normal levels of reproductive hormones , which can stem from genetic factors or autoimmune disease. For these women, hormone therapy is typically recommended until the natural age of menopause. Induced menopause: This can happen, if ovaries are removed due to for medical reasons such as uterine cancer or endometriosis.Cancer therapies like chemotherapy and radiation therapy can induce menopause if they cause damage to the ovaries. Symptoms such as hot flashes can be experienced during or shortly after the course of treatment. The halt to menstruation (and fertility) is not always permanent following chemotherapy, so birth control measures need to be taken. Radiation therapy only affects ovarian function, if radiation is directed at the ovaries. Radiation therapy to other parts of the body such as breast tissue or the head and neck does not premature menopause. PostmenopauseAfter going through menopause, you will be in the post-menopause phase for the rest of your life. Since, the body has nearly stopped producing estrogen, postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of various health conditions such as heart diseases, osteoporosis (weakening of bones), and urinary tract infections. Many women may also experience relief in the symptoms they were undergoing during the perimenopause phase. Hot flashes may ease after some time, but some females continue experiencing these symptoms for ten more years or longer. Every womenΓÇÖs risk and experience post menopause is different.

Physical examBefore visiting your doctor, you can try tracking your symptoms and noting them somewhere. You can also record their frequency and severity along with your last period and any irregularities in your cycle. Talk to your doctor about any medications or supplements that you might be taking. Usually, the described symptoms are enough evidence for the diagnosis of menopause. 2. Vaginal swabYour healthcare provider may direct you to take a vaginal swab. This will help them test your vaginal pH. The vaginal pH is around 4.5 during your reproductive years and can rise to a pH balance of 6 during menopause. Reduced estrogen during menopause affects a womanΓÇÖs vaginal pH. 3.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test Your doctor may order a blood test to check the levels of FSH along with estrogen. When women undergo menopause, their FSH levels tend to increase, and estrogen levels decrease. FSH is responsible for stimulating the maturation of eggs and for producing estradiol, a form of estrogen. Estradiol has several functions, including regulating the menstrual cycle and protecting the female reproductive system. When a womanΓÇÖs FSH levels have constantly been elevated to 30 mIU/mL or higher, and she hasnΓÇÖt had periods for over 12 months, it is generally diagnosed as menopause. However, a single FSH rest with elevated results does not necessarily indicate menopause. Multiple subsequent tests are needed to establish the diagnosis. Along with this, the FSH tests can detect signs of pituitary disorder since the anterior pituitary gland releases FSH. 4.Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test Your doctor may order a TSH test since the symptoms of hypothyroidism often resemble those of menopause. Hypothyroidism is a medical condition in which the thyroid gland produces less than the average amount of thyroid. The TSH test also indicates how much T4 hormone is being made. A high TSH level means that the thyroid gland is making excessive T4 because there isnΓÇÖt enough T4 available in the body. This indicates hypothyroidism. The result of this test will help your doctor rule out the possibility of hypothyroidism. 5.PicoAMH Elisa diagnostic test This recent test allows a diagnostician to evaluate if you have reached menopause or are likely to reach it. It measures the levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) in the blood, a protein hormone released during pregnancy. The test alone is not enough for the diagnosis of menopause. It can be used along with bone mineral density tests and hormonal tests. Along with this, your doctor may order some other tests such as a lipid profile and tests for liver and kidney functions. Women experience a change in their lipid profile during menopause that can help with the final diagnosis. 6.Inhibin A and inhibin BThe fall in inhibin A and inhibin B may also be useful for assessing reproductive ageing.

There are certain medications and therapies available to relieve and manage the signs and symptoms of menopause. Your doctor will also help you with treatment modalities to prevent the development of any chronic medical condition resulting from menopause. 1. Hormone therapyDoctors recommend taking the estrogen hormone as it's an effective way to manage menopausal hot flashes. A hot flash is a sudden feeling of warmth over the upper body that is more intense over your face and neck. To relieve your symptoms, your doctor can provide you with a low dosage of estrogen for a limited time. The dosage will be decided based on your family history and personal medical history. In some, cases your doctor may also prescribe you progestin along with estrogen. Definite benefits of hormone therapy include improvement in symptoms of menopause, increase in bone mineral density and decrease in fracture risk. Long-term usage of hormones can increase the risk of endometrial cancer, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, breast cancer, or gallbladder disease. However, taking these medications for a limited time period has proven to be beneficial for women going through the symptoms of menopause. It is essential to talk to your doctor about your medical and family history, along with the risks and benefits of taking hormonal therapy. 2. Vaginal estrogenIt is common for women to experience increased vaginal dryness during perimenopause and postmenopause. To relieve that, estrogen hormone can be administered directly into the vagina. This is done through a vaginal cream, tablet or a ring. The vaginal estrogen modalities work by releasing low amounts of estrogen directly into the vagina that is absorbed by the vaginal walls. It helps in relieving vaginal dryness and manages discomfort associated with intercourse and urinary problems. 3. AntidepressantsCertain medications from the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can relieve menopausal hot flashes. A low dose antidepressant is helpful for women looking for ways to manage their hot flashes. It is usually prescribed for women who cannot take estrogen due to allergy or other health reasons. Women who are suffering from mood disorders due to menopause are also prescribed low dosages of antidepressants. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant which works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain. This improves mood and physical symptoms of depression and also relieves symptoms of panic and obsessive disorders. 4. Anti-seizure medicationsGabapentin is an anti-seizure drug that is used to treat seizures. It has also shown promising results in managing menopausal hot flashes in women who can't use estrogen therapy. It is also helpful for women who have hot flashes at night. 5.ClonidineThis drug is an adrenergic agonist and has been found to reduce the frequency of hot flashes significantly. It is widely used as a non-hormonal treatment for hot flashes in breast cancer patients too. Your doctor will observe the effectiveness of the drug for two to four weeks. If there is no significant reduction in hot flashes, then the drug usage will be reviewed. 6.Vitamin D supplementsThe decline in estrogen level after menopause is known to affect bone density in women. Depending on your needs, you may need treatment to prevent or treat osteoporosis. There are several medications available that can improve osteoporosis and reduce the risk of fractures. Several women are also given Vitamin D supplements to strengthen bone density.\"),\n",

However, estrogen is solely not responsible for these diseases. Age and other factors also play a role in their development. 1. Heart diseasesThe risk of developing heart conditions increases after menopause. Postmenopausal women are more likely to have a heart attack than men. The steep decline in estrogen levels post-menopause increases the risk of having irregular heartbeats (palpitations). If a woman suffers heart palpitations, it is pertinent to meet a doctor to decide the best course of action. 2. OsteoporosisThe decline in estrogen levels puts postmenopausal women at an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Estrogen plays a vital role in supporting the production of new osteoblasts responsible for creating bone. After menopause, the osteoblasts are not able to get an ample amount of estrogen hormone. This eventually leads to the cells failing to regenerate new bone structures. Ultimately osteoclasts responsible for absorbing bone overpower the rate of bone regeneration leading to the weakening of bone. Osteoporosis can lead to an increased rate of fractures in the hips and spine. Having a fracture at an older age is a serious problem since the body recovers at a slower pace. Here is more about postmenopausal osteoporosis and ways to deal with it. Click To Know More! 3. Urinary problemsUrinary incontinence occurs when women experience an involuntary release of urine. It is common in aging and postmenopausal women. The reduced estrogen level causes the thinning of the lining of the urethra (the tube that joins the bladder to the body's exterior) and the vaginal wall. This can lead to urinary leakage and often occurs during sudden movements such as sneezing or laughing. 4. Sexual problemsVaginal dryness from decreased moisture production and loss of elasticity can cause discomfort and slight bleeding during sexual intercourse. Also, decreased sensation may reduce your desire for sexual activity (libido). Water-based vaginal moisturisers and lubricants may help. If a vaginal lubricant isn't enough, many women benefit from the use of local vaginal estrogen treatment, available as a vaginal cream, tablet, or ring. 5. Weight gainSeveral women experience weight gain after hitting menopause. This is also the result of aging, along with the effects of menopause. With increasing age, it's harder to maintain muscle mass, and the decreased muscle mass further reduces metabolism. This makes the process of weight gain easier than before. Women often end up gaining weight around the abdominal region after menopause. This increase in fat increases the risk of heart diseases. 6. Visual disturbancesEstrogen gives more elasticity to the corneas of the eyes. In menopause and perimenopause, when estrogen levels are reduced, the corneas do not get as much estrogen. Thereby, the corneas begin to stiffen which can affect how light travels into your eyes. This can also lead to blurred vision. Dry eyes can also be experienced during menopause. Symptoms may include itchiness, a burning sensation, eye pain, certainly dryness, mucus discharge from the eye, and it may even feel like thereΓÇÖs a foreign body actually on your eyeball. Wearing contact lenses can also get uncomfortable. 7. Central nervous system problemsAlzheimer's disease is more common in women after menopause.

Acute phaseAfter a silent incubation period of 2 to 4 days, patients generally display the chikungunya symptoms that may persist 3ΓÇô7 days during the acute phase of the disease. The following treatment protocols are usually followed during this phase: Rest should be one of the main recommendations as physical activities tend to aggravate the joint pain, contributing to local wear and thus to prolonging the clinical condition. Certain local measures like the application of cold compresses or ice packs and pain relief gels to the affected joints can reduce swelling and pain. The two most commonly used medications prescribed for mild to moderate pain are Paracetamol and Metamizole. NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin are usually avoided because of the risk of bleeding. In the case of severe-intensity pain, Paracetamol or Metamizole might be combined with opioids like Tramadol. 2. Post acute phaseWhile most patients start showing signs of recovery after a week, in some cases chronic and incapacitating joint pain can persist. In the case of moderate to severe pain that is not responding satisfactorily to the medications in use, other drugs must be recommended.

The diagnosis of acute encephalitis is suspected in a febrile patient presenting altered consciousness. To diagnose encephalitis, your healthcare provider might order tests, perform a medical exam and discuss medical history. A. Clinical historyBefore confirming the patient is having encephalitis, it is essential to rule out the conditions that may mimic the symptoms of encephalitis. A physician performs a detailed overview checkup, reviewing the patientΓÇÖs history, and the onset of symptoms to rule out other potential causes. B. Lab tests and imaging studies 1. Imaging tests: Tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can be used to view the cross-sectional area of the brain. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can also be performed depending on availability. Imaging tests can reveal the abnormalities in the brain and the cause of the seizure-like tumor, lesions, and causes of cerebral dysfunction. These tests can also check for any problems that can make performing a lumbar puncture or a spinal tap risky. 2. Lumbar puncture: Also known as a spinal tap, this test is done to obtain a sample of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), a protective fluid that flows through the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. When the brain and meninges are inflamed, the number of white cells in cerebrospinal fluid increases. Sometimes, samples of CSF can be tested to identify the virus or other infectious agent that is causing encephalitis. 3. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR): PCR produces many copies of a gene which helps in detecting the genetic material of viruses in a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. It has become the primary diagnostic test for central nervous system (CNS infections) caused by viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and enteroviruses. 4.Electroencephalogram (EEG): EEG helps to record the brain's electrical activity. It does not detect the virus that causes encephalitis, but certain abnormal patterns on the EEG may indicate a diagnosis of encephalitis. 5. Other lab tests: Blood tests including complete blood count (CBC) along with urine or serum toxicology screening tests may be done to test for viruses or other infectious agents. 6. Intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP): Any brain swelling can be diagnosed by increase in pressure inside the skull. 7. Brain biopsy: In very rare cases, a small sample of brain tissue might be removed for testing. This procedure is not preferred because of its high risk of complications. A brain biopsy is usually done only if the other tests do not give an answer or symptoms are worsening and treatments are having no effect. 8.

These can occur in patches, vary in size and can develop anywhere on the body. The symptoms of the condition vary depending upon the type. The most common types of hyperpigmentation are: 1. SunspotsSunspots, solar lentigines or age spots are seen quite commonly. They are also called liver spots but are not related to any liver disorder. They are caused due to excessive exposure to the sun over time. Sunspots appear as brown, black or tan spots and are spread across the face, back of the hands and skin that has been exposed to the sun for a long time. 2. MelasmaMelasma also known as chloasma is characterised by the presentation of hyperpigmented brown to greyish brown patches on the face including the cheeks, upper lip and forehead, as well as the forearms. It sometimes affects arms, neck, tummy, back or any part of skin that is exposed to sunlight. Melasma is also called the ΓÇÿmask of pregnancyΓÇÖ because it primarily affects pregnant women. It is also seen in women taking oral contraceptives. Non-pregnant women and dark-skinned men can also get affected. It is more prevalent and lasts longer in people with dark skin. 3. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)It is caused due to an injury or inflammation of the skin. It presents as patches or spots of darkened skin. It usually occurs after an inflammatory skin condition such as the presence of acne or eczema. It usually occurs on the face or neck.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Hyperpigmentation', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content=\"The most common cause of hyperpigmentation is excessive production of melanin pigment. There are different conditions or factors that can alter the production of melanin in the body that lead to hyperpigmentation such as: 1. Excessive exposure of the sunProlonged exposure towards the sun can cause the body to produce more melanin to protect the skin from the harmful rays of the sun. This results in patches or dark spots that are also known as sun spots or age spots. They are usually seen during middle age and increase in number with age. There is a direct correlation between skin pigmentation seen in people with the geographical distribution of ultraviolet radiation. Dark-skinned people are mostly present in areas that receive higher amounts of UVB radiation and light-skinned people inhabit areas that are further away from the tropics. 2. Skin inflammationPeople can experience the darkening of the skin after inflammation of that area. This includes inflammation caused due to acne, psoriasis, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and allergic contact. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is more severe in cases of recurrent inflammation as compared to short-term acute inflammation. The resulting hyperpigmentation can last for months to years and can hamper a person's quality of life. 3. MelasmaAlso known as 'chloasma' or the ΓÇ£mask of pregnancy,ΓÇ¥ occurs in pregnant women. It is a common skin problem that causes dark discoloured patchy hyperpigmentation. It typically occurs on the face and is symmetrical, with matching marks on both sides of the face. Melasma is seen mainly in women across all age groups and races. Men can also get affected by melasma. It is more prevalent and lasts longer in people with dark skin. The exact cause behind melasma hasnΓÇÖt been determined yet but some factors are directly linked with the same. This includes an increase in estrogen levels during pregnancy or due to the usage of oral contraceptive pills. Melasma usually resolves on its own after pregnancy or when a woman stops taking birth control pills. Some people may also have a genetic predisposition towards melasma or may suffer from conditions such as thyroid or liver disorders. UV exposure exacerbates the development of melasma. Melasma can appear on the skin at any point in time, and your day-to-day skin care routine may not be enough to combat its appearance. Read this to learn about how to get rid of melasma. Read Here! 4. Reaction to certain drugsUsing medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and antimalarial drugs can cause hyperpigmentation. This can result in patches of skin to make a greyish hue. Sometimes, the chemicals present in topical treatment can cause hyperpigmentation too. 5. Addison's diseaseAddison's disease is a medical condition that affects a personΓÇÖs adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located above the kidneys and produce hormones that influence every tissue and organ of the body. Addison's disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system starts to attack the adrenal glands themselves. This can also result in hyperpigmentation of elbows, knees, folds of skin, lips, knuckles, and toes. Some other symptoms of Addison's disease include fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting. 6. HemochromatosisThis is a medical condition that is inheritable and causes the body to retain too much iron. It can result in hyperpigmentation of the skin in which the skin starts to look more tanner or darker than usual. Other symptoms of the condition include stomach pain, joint pain, fatigue, and weight loss. 7. Acanthosis nigricansHyperpigmentation of intertriginous areas like the nape of the neck, and armpits is associated with insulin resistance leading to diabetes and metabolic syndrome (cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes). 8. Linea nigraIt is the presence of a hyperpigmented line found on the abdomen during pregnancy. 9. PeutzΓÇôJeghers syndromeThis is an autosomal dominant (passed through the families) disorder characterised by hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa and gastrointestinal polyps. 10. Smoker's melanosisThis can be seen with the naked eye as a brown to black pigmentation of the oral tissue i.e. the gums, cheeks or palate as well as in the larynx. It is most often seen in the lower gums of tobacco users. 11. Mercury poisoningThis particularly causes darkening of the outer layer of the skin, resulting from the topical application of mercurial ointments for skin-whitening. 12. PorphyriaIt is a group of liver disorders in which substances called porphyrins build up in the body, negatively affecting the skin. This causes local skin damage and resultant hyperpigmentation in the long run. 13. Metabolic causesThese include vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 and folic acid. 14. CancerAlthough not as common, in many cases of malignancy, especially related to melanoma, diffuse hyperpigmentation is seen. This is more common in patients with metastatic disease and/or those patients who present with melanoma of an unknown origin.\"),\n",

They include: 1. Topical creamsMany people opt to use over-the-counter topical creams that contain ingredients that can lighten the skin. This includes creams that contain kojic acid, azelaic acid, hydroquinone, retinoids, and Vitamin C. Topical prescription creams with hydroquinone can lighten the skin. Hydroquinone remains a workhorse of melasma and hyperpigmentation management and is often considered the topical ΓÇ£gold standardΓÇ¥. However, it is not advisable to use topical hydroquinone for a long time since it can cause the skin to darken further called ochronosis. Always consult a dermatologist before using a cream containing hydroquinone to get the right guidance on how you can use the cream. Creams containing retinoids or kojic acid can take a couple of months to show their effect. 2. Chemical peelsAn effective way of treating hyperpigmentation is chemical peels. This technique involves applying a chemical solution to the skin that leads to the area's exfoliation and peeling. The skin that regenerates in that area is smoother and less wrinkled. Usually, chemicals such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and trichloroacetic acid are used for chemical peels. If you are using a topical retinoid, talk to your doctor before using an over-the-counter peel. You may need to stop retinoid use for seven days before the peel. Superficial chemical peels use alpha-hydroxy acid or other mild acids that only penetrate the outer layer of the skin and improve mild skin discoloration. Medium strength chemical peels use glycolic or trichloroacetic acid that can penetrate the outer and middle layers of the skin. This treatment reduces age spots and moderate skin discoloration. Deep chemical peels use trichloroacetic acid or phenol. The chemical penetrates the deeper layer of the skin and can help in reducing shallow scars and age spots. 3. DermabrasionThis medical procedure uses a wire brush or diamond wheel that can level the superficial layer of the skin. The areas that are treated with dermabrasion heal and allow new skin to regenerate. Dermabrasion foremost injures the skin and patients who opt for the procedure should be prepared for how they will look right after the treatment and during the time the skin regenerates. The patient needs to talk to their doctor and have realistic expectations from the treatment. The result of dermabrasion can take up to several weeks or months to become evident. 4. Laser resurfacingLaser resurfacing is a popular medical procedure that uses a laser device to improve the way the skin appears to be. It is also used to treat minor flaws and remove layers of skin. Carbon dioxide or CO2 laser is the most commonly used laser that can treat minor wrinkles, scars, and other conditions. Erbium laser is used to improve superficial and deep lines on the face, hand, and chest. It causes fewer side effects than the CO2 laser.

Hypofractionated radiation therapy: In this type of radiation therapy a higher-than-usual total radiation dose is delivered once a day for a shorter time (fewer days). This therapy may have more side effects than regular radiation therapy. Internal radiation therapy: Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance filled in needles, seeds, or catheters inserted into cancer tissue. After the radioactive seeds are implanted in the prostate, the needles are removed after the procedure. 3. Radiopharmaceutical therapyThis therapy uses radioactive drugs to target and destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. The following are examples of radiopharmaceutical therapy: Alpha emitter radiation therapy treats prostate cancer that has spread deep to the bones. Radium-223, a radioactive material, is administered into a vein and circulated through the bloodstream. It gathers in cancerous parts of the bone and destroys the cancer cells. 4. Hormone therapyHormone therapy treats cancer by inhibiting cancer cell growth or blocking hormones. The term for this therapy is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The following are some hormone therapies for prostate cancer: Abiraterone acetate is a drug that inhibits the production of androgens in prostate cancer cells. Orchiectomy is a surgical treatment that involves the removal of one or both testicles, which are the source of male hormones like testosterone, to reduce the quantity of hormone produced. Estrogens (hormones that promote feminine sex characteristics) can inhibit the production of testosterone in the testicles. Estrogens are unlikely to be used in treating prostate cancer nowadays due to their adverse effects. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists inhibit testosterone production in the testicles. Leuprolide, Goserelin acetate, and Buserelin are among the examples. Antiandrogens can block the activity of androgens. Flutamide, Bicalutamide, Enzalutamide, Apalutamide, and Nilutamide are a few examples of these compounds.Finding it difficult to get all your medications on time?

Race: Osteoporosis is a chronic health condition affecting primarily white women. Advanced age: Research has shown that age is a high-risk factor for osteoporosis, as Vitamin D insufficiency and reduced calcium absorption are common in the elderly. Female sex:Studies suggest osteoporosis is commonly encountered in older women with no underlying risk factors. Women tend to have a younger onset of bone loss compared with men. Amenorrhea: It is the absence of menstruation. This happens to die to low estrogen levels, which can cause osteoporosis. Early menopause: Menopause in less than 45 years of age, surgical removal of both ovaries, and prolonged perimenopausal absence of periods can lead to osteoporosis. Hormone-related disorders: Diseases that can trigger osteoporosis due to overproduction or underproduction of certain hormones include: Overactive thyroid gland Reduced amounts of sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) Disorders of the pituitary gland Overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). Primary and secondary hypogonadism (when sex glands produce little or no hormones) in men.

A history of abdominal pain for the last 12-24 hours without fever or diarrhea that migrates to the lower right side of the stomach along with tenderness. You might be asked about the starting of your symptoms, along with ongoing medicines for any other disease. Physical examinationTo diagnose appendicitis, your doctor will perform a physical test. You might be asked to pinpoint the area of the abdomen where you feel the pain. The doctor will apply gentle pressure on the painful area to check the abdominal rigidity and a tendency for you to stiffen your abdominal muscles in response to pressure over the inflamed appendix.Note: The physical examination may be unrevealing in the very early stages of appendicitis and the signs and symptoms might be subtle. Imaging testsThese tests show whether the abdominal pain is caused by any obstruction inside the appendix, an enlarged or burst appendix, inflammation, an abscess, or something else. They include: Abdominal ultrasound: Abdominal ultrasonography uses sound waves to produce an image of internal organs, without the use of X-rays or radiation. It is a widely used primary measure to evaluate patients with acute abdominal pain. Abdominal Computerized tomography (CT): CT scans use X-rays to produce internal images. An abdominal CT scan has greater than 95% accuracy for the diagnosis of appendicitis. Abdominal Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI Scan uses strong magnetic and radio waves to create detailed and clear 3D images of the body's internal organs. However, performing an abdominal MRI is expensive and also demands a high level of expertise to interpret the results. Note: In order to reduce radiation exposure, it is recommended for pregnant women and children to undergo an ultrasound or MRI instead of a CT scan. Abdominal x-rays: Abdominal X-rays do not have a role in diagnosis of acute appendicitis, but in some cases appendicoliths may be visible on it. Barium enema test: This can assist in identifying appendicitis in patients with atypical symptoms. It can detect signs of inflammation in the appendix, as well as other abnormalities in the colon or pelvis. Laboratory tests Complete blood count (CBC): Your doctor will recommend a CBC to check for a high white blood cell count, which could be a sign of infection. C-reactive protein test: This test is recommended to check any other causes of abdominal inflammation such as autoimmune disorders. Urine and stool test: Urinalysis and stool test is done for diagnosis of any infection, inflammation, kidney stone that is causing pain.

This type of appendectomy is suggested if the appendix has ruptured and the infection has spread. Laparoscopic appendectomy: The surgeon makes up to three tiny incisions in the belly to insert a laparoscope, which is a camera and light attached to a thin tube that allows the surgeon to observe the abdomen internally. After identifying the appendix, it is stitched up and removed. Laparoscopic procedures are preferred due to fewer complications and a quicker recovery period. Here are a few tips to follow post-surgery. Post-operative care includes: Keep the incision site clean with water and gentle soap Change the dressing as and when suggested by the doctor Limit your physical activity and do not lifting any heavy objects Drink plenty of water and fluids and adding more fiber to ease constipation Do not strain the abdominal muscles by climbing stairs or doing exercise that involves stomach Ask your doctor about when is safe to return to your regular job, and about the follow up visits Keeping a check on your symptoms.

Ideally, each hair follicle goes through three phases: 1. Anagen phase is the active phase of hair growth that usually lasts for about two to six years. Around 85-90% of the hair on the scalp is in this stage at a given point in time. 2. Catagen phase is the transitional phase that lasts a few weeks (2-3 weeks). Only 1% of hair is in this stage. 3. Telogen phase is the end phase of hair growth, which is the resting phase. Around 13% of our hair is in this stage. At the end of the telogen phase, hair follicles are shed, which is replaced by new hair and the cycle continues. However, the hair growth cycle can be influenced by an individualΓÇÖs age, diseases, hair care routine, and diet. Common causes of hair loss include: Age: With age, it is common to notice some amount of hair fall. Men and women both notice receding hairline as well as thinning of hair. Genetics: Hereditary causes are the most common cause of hair loss all over the world and both men and women are affected. It is also known as androgenic alopecia, male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness. It appears as a receding hairline and bald spots in men and thinning hair along the crown and a widening part in women. Childbirth and other stressors: If you have recently given birth, or have had a chronic illness it can lead to hair fall. Stress or any kind of traumatic event may also trigger hair loss. Ongoing treatment/medications: Certain undergoing treatment such as treatment for cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, gout and high blood pressure can trigger hair fall within a few days or weeks of starting the radiation or chemotherapy. Tight hairstyles: Tight hairstyles such as braids can lead to hair fall over time. This is permanent hair loss and is known as traction alopecia. Scalp infections: A scalp infection, which appears as scaly and inflamed results in hair loss. Hormonal imbalance: Certain women experience hair loss due to hormonal imbalances in conditions such as PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Birth control pills, which are hormonal preparations, can also trigger hair fall. Nutritional deficiencies: If your diet lacks protein, zinc, biotin, iron or any other essential nutrient then you may notice hair fall and thinning of hair. Disease: Diseases such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, diabetes, lupus and STIΓÇÖs (sexually transmitted infections) can lead to hair fall as well as bald patches on the eyebrows, lashes, and other parts of the body.

Vitamin B7 (Biotin): This vitamin is known to stimulate keratin production in hair and can increase the rate of follicle growth. Supplements of Vitamin B12 are beneficial for regrowing hair in people with its deficiency. Zinc: Zinc is an essential mineral thatΓÇÖs involved in several biological processes within your body. It plays a key role in making proteins in your hair and other cells. Iron: The best way to treat hair loss with ferritin is to increase your iron levels. Hair loss as a result of low iron is not permanent and it can be treated with supplements and foods rich in iron. 2. Minoxidil It is an over-the-counter medication that is FDA approved for use in both men and women. Administered topically, the 5 % concentration is used to treat male pattern baldness whereas 2% is only approved for female pattern baldness treatment. It stops the thinning of hair and is known to stimulate hair growth. 3.FinasterideIt is also an FDA-approved drug for the medical management of hair loss but only in men. It is a prescription drug that is commonly used to treat an enlarged prostate, but a higher dose is used to treat hair fall. It stops the production of the hormone 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), excess of which is known to cause hair loss. 4. Topical corticosteroids or steroid injectionsThese are steroids that help to stop inflammation and treat hair loss. This usually comes in the form of topical cream or injection that needs to be injected into the scalp to promote hair growth. These injections are usually given every 4 to 8 weeks as needed. Talk to your dermatologist to know about it. B. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapyPRP is a process in which the patient's own blood is processed and injected into different points in the scalp. PRP, which is rich in growth factors helps in hair growth. The following steps are followed: Step 1 - The blood is drawn usually from the arm and processed in a centrifuge (a machine that spins and separates fluids of different densities). Step 2 - After about 10 minutes in the centrifuge, the blood separates into three layers: platelet-poor plasma platelet-rich plasma red blood cellsStep 3 - The scalp is locally anesthetized. The platelet-rich plasma is drawn up into a syringe and injected into areas of the scalp that require more hair growth. C. Hair transplantationDuring a hair transplant procedure, a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon removes hair from a part of the head that has hair and transplants it to a bald spot. Possible risks include bleeding, bruising, swelling and infection. Follicular unit extraction (FUE) and follicular unit transplantation (FUT) are the two most common techniques for hair transplants. Talk to your dermatologist to know which procedure best suits your condition. 1. Follicular Unit Transplantation or FUT FUT is the older of the two methods and uses strips of skin with hair on them from your scalp itself to be transplanted in a bald spot. The scarring left behind on the donor site is covered up with new hair. This technique requires much aftercare and is quite a hassle to go through. 2. Follicular Unit Extraction or FUE It is a newer technique and is sufficiently advanced in the technology it uses to get the result. In this method, incisions are made around every follicle unit, which is then transplanted to the balding area. This method leads to very little scarring, and the recovery process takes a lot less time compared to FUT. D.

This test assesses the sharpness and clarity of vision. Both eyes are tested individually for their ability to see letters of varying sizes. RetinoscopyIt involves shining a light into your eyes and observing how it bounces back. By adjusting the power of the light, the eye doctor can determine if you\\'re nearsighted (myopic) and the strength of your prescription needs. Auto refractometerThis high-tech gadget quickly and accurately measures your prescription using invisible light, requiring no action on your part. It benefits screening people with myopia and has almost replaced traditional retinoscopy for routine checks. Corneal topographyThis step is crucial for detecting cornea-related issues in myopic patients and helps determine suitability for laser eye surgery. Machines like Orbscan or Pentacam provide detailed maps of your cornea\\'s shape and thickness, aiding eye surgeons in planning the best treatment. Slit-lamp examinationThis involves looking closely at your eyes with a special microscope called a slit lamp. This examination offers a detailed view of your eye\\'s structures, including the cornea, lens, and retina, helping to identify any abnormalities associated with myopia. Additional testsIn some cases, additional tests may be performed to evaluate specific eye health or vision aspects. These tests may include measuring intraocular pressure (tonometry) to screen for glaucoma or assessing the cornea\\'s curvature (keratometry) to determine the shape of the eye\\'s surface. Note: Regular eye examinations are essential, especially if you notice changes in your vision or if you have a family history of eye conditions like myopia. Early detection and management can help prevent complications and maintain optimal eye health.Did you know?The severity of myopia is measured in diopters, with higher values indicating greater nearsightedness.

Studies suggest that increased exposure to natural light may help reduce the risk of Myopia. Doctors recommend 60-80 minutes of outdoor play per day to allow natural light to enter the eyes, relax eye muscles, and promote healthy habits. Limit screen time: Reduce prolonged near-work activities, such as reading or screen time, especially in young children. Encourage breaks and frequent focus shifts to prevent eye strain. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Take breaks every 20 minutes and look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eye strain from prolonged near work. Ensure proper lighting: Maintain adequate lighting when reading or performing close-up tasks to reduce eye strain and promote comfortable vision. Consume a healthy diet: A balanced diet rich in the following nutrients are beneficial for eye health and can contribute to preventing Myopia: Vitamin A: Abundantly found in carrots, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, and apricots, vitamin A is essential for retinal health. It supports clear vision and prevents dry eyes. Vitamin C: Acting as a powerful antioxidant, shields against cellular damage, aids in eye tissue repair, and helps prevent age-related degeneration of eyes and cataracts.Rich sources include oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, peaches, red bell peppers, and tomatoes. Vitamin E: Promotes cell health, acts as an antioxidant to combat oxidative stress, and contributes to overall eye health. Avocados, almonds, and sunflower seeds are excellent sources. Omega-3 fatty acids: Help reduce the risk of eye diseases like AMD, improve tear function, and support overall eye health. Rich sources include salmon, tuna, sardines, halibut, and trout.

Bifocal or progressive lenses may be necessary for individuals over 40 with presbyopia, a condition where it becomes difficult to focus on close objects. Contact Lenses It offers clear vision and a broader field of view than glasses, often preferred during sports or social activities. Proper hygiene is crucial for eye health. Read the article on common mistakes contact lens wearers make. Here II. Surgical treatmentLASIKIt involves creating a corneal flap and reshaping tissue with a laser to correct nearsightedness. It is preferred for moderate to severe cases, offering rapid recovery and improved vision. Epi-LASIK (Epithelial Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis)Like LASIK, Epi-LASIK corrects nearsightedness by reshaping the cornea with a laser. However, it involves gently separating and preserving the corneal epithelium (outer layer) before laser treatment, which can result in a slightly longer recovery time compared to LASIK. PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy)This procedure removes the corneal epithelium entirely before reshaping tissue with a laser. It is preferred for thin corneas or active individuals (involved in contact sports), and it has a longer recovery period. Phakic Intraocular LensesImplanted in front of the natural lens for high myopia or thin corneas, providing an alternative to corneal surgeries. Intraocular Lens ImplantThis surgery involves replacing the natural lens with an artificial one, suitable for those seeking clear vision without glasses or contacts. SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction)It is a minimally invasive surgery involving the extraction of a lenticule from the cornea to correct myopia without creating a corneal flap. It potentially reduces complications and recovery time. Tips for a swift recovery after eye surgery: 1. Follow your doctor's aftercare instructions diligently. 2. Use lubricating eye drops as prescribed to maintain eye health and ease discomfort. 3. If recommended, wear non-prescription sunglasses or goggles temporarily after surgery. 4. Keep your hands clean and avoid dusty environments to prevent infection. 5. Wear UV-protective sunglasses outdoors to protect your eyes. 6. Get enough rest and avoid strenuous activities to aid healing. 7. Arrange for assistance at home as your vision may be blurry after surgery. 8.

Two internal biological mechanisms ΓÇô circadian rhythm and homeostasis ΓÇô work together to regulate when you are awake and asleep. One of the key hormones responsible for maintenance of the sleep wake cycle is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland in our body. Circadian rhythmsCircadian rhythm influences many functions from daily fluctuations in wakefulness to body temperature, metabolism, and release of hormones. It controls the cause of being sleepy at night and the tendency to wake in the morning without an alarm. The bodyΓÇÖs biological clock, which is based on a roughly 24-hour day, controls most circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms synchronize with environmental cues (light and temperature) about the actual time of day, but they continue even in the absence of cues as they are not driven by the environment. Sleep-wake homeostasisIt keeps track of your need for sleep. The homeostatic sleep drive reminds the body to sleep after a certain time and regulates sleep intensity. This sleep drive gets stronger every hour you are awake and causes you to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.Factors that influence your sleep-wake needs include medical conditions, medications, stress, sleep environment, and what you eat and drink.'),\n",

Cognitive behavioral therapyCognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can help you control or eliminate negative thoughts and actions that keep you awake and is generally recommended as the first line of treatment for people with insomnia. Typically, CBT-I is equally or more effective than sleep medications. The cognitive part of CBT-I teaches you to recognize and change beliefs that affect your ability to sleep while the behavioral part of CBT-I helps you develop good sleep habits and avoid behaviors that keep you from sleeping well. 2. Medications 1. Benzodiazepines It inhibits the reticular activating system (RAS) center, also known as awakening center, thereby inducing sleep. Benzodiazepines carry a risk of addiction and abuse, especially in patients with history of alcohol or sedative abuse, so medical supervision is advisable. Some of the common examples of this class of drugs include: Alprazolam Lorazepam Clonazepam 2. Barbiturates These drugs act on the GABA receptor thereby aiding in sleep. It causes long term changes thereby ensuring that the effect of the drug lasts for a long time. Examples include: Thiopentone sodium Methohexitone Phenobarbitone3. (Z) Drugs These drugs are basically newer drugs of benzodiazepine agonist class, however they are relatively more specific as these act on alpha 1 subunit of GABA-A receptor. These are recommended for early phase insomnia, late phase insomnia and middle of night awakening problems. The medications that belong to this group include: Zolpidem Zopiclone Zaleplon4. Heterocyclic antidepressants These are the most commonly prescribed alternatives to benzodiazepine receptor agonists due to their lack of abuse potential and lower cost. The common examples include: Trazodone Amitriptyline5. Melatonin receptor agonists As the name suggests, these drugs act on the melatonin receptor to include sleep. These drugs are mostly recommended for people with sleep cycle disorder (people who sleep at any time other than the actual sleeping time), shift workers, and insomnia due to jet lag. Some of the common drugs include: Ramelton Agomelatine6. Orexin pathway inhibitors These drugs inhibit the chemical orexin, which is known to keep the RAS center active. Suvorexant is a commonly used drug that belongs to this class. 7. Antihistamines Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine are the primary active ingredients in the most over-the-counter sleep aids.

Understanding the transmission cycle is very important in knowing the cause. TransmissionThis virus exists in the zoonotic transmission cycle, which means the infections spread from animals, through insects to humans. The general carriers and hosts of this virus are: Mosquitoes: The major mosquito vectors of JEV vary in different geographic regions. Culicine mosquitoes, mainly the Vishnui group of Culex, are the chief vectors of JE in different parts of India. Pigs: Pigs serve as an amplifier host since they allow virus multiplication manifold without suffering from disease and maintain prolonged high levels of virus. Due to this, mosquitoes get the opportunity to get infected from pigs easily. Water birds belonging to the family Ardeidae (cattle egrets and pond herons): Ardeidae birds are important maintenance hosts. Humans: Humans are the end host in the transmission cycle. Mosquitoes do not get infections from JE patients. There is no human-to-human transmission of JE. Note: In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season.

COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus, first identified in 2019, while the flu is caused by influenza viruses. Despite their similarities, these two infections have distinct characteristics. Here are some key similarities and differences: 1. Duration of Illness Similarity: Both conditions take 1 or more days after exposure for symptoms to appear. Difference: COVID-19 symptoms may take longer to appear, while flu symptoms typically develop within 1-4 days. 2. Duration of Virus Spread Similarity : Both viruses can be transmitted at least 1 day before symptoms appear. Difference: People infected with COVID-19 may remain contagious for a longer period (up to 7 days or more) compared to those with the flu. 3. Mode of Spread Similarity: Both viruses spread through respiratory droplets when infected individuals cough, sneeze, or talk, typically within close contact (about 6 feet). Difference: Although both viruses spread similarly, COVID-19 tends to be more contagious than the flu. 4. Individuals at Risk Similarity: Older adults, individuals with underlying health conditions, and pregnant women are at higher risk of severe illness from both COVID-19 and the flu. Difference: COVID-19 may cause more severe illness, resulting in hospitalization or death even in previously healthy individuals. 5.

Different mosquito species live in different habitat: some lives in the wild, some are domestic and some in both habitat. There are 3 types of transmission cycles: Sylvatic (or jungle) yellow fever: In tropical rainforests, monkeys, which are the primary reservoir of yellow fever, are bitten by wild mosquitoes of the Aedes and Haemogogus species, they pass the virus on to other monkeys. The humans traveling in the forest are bitten by infected mosquitoes and later develop yellow fever. Intermediate yellow fever: During this type of transmission, semi-domestic mosquitoes (those that breed both in the wild and around households) infect both monkeys and people. Increased contact between people and infected mosquitoes leads to increased transmission. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa. Urban yellow fever:** Large epidemics occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with a high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination or prior exposure to yellow fever.Is Your Home A Mosquito Magnet?

A more severe case can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, other hemorrhagic fevers, and infection with other flaviviruses (such as dengue hemorrhagic fever). 1. History and physical examinationThe diagnosis requires a thorough travel history and record of immunization. The doctor may evaluate the present symptoms such as headache, malaise, jaundice, and myalgias with severe back pain. The incubation period of the virus is usually 3-7 days, with most individuals having a mild flu-like illness. In severe 15% of cases, symptoms include chills, low back pain, headache, and fever. During the physical examination, the doctor may check the Faget sign or pulse fever dissociation, facial flushing, and conjunctival injection. During the most toxic phase, patients develop jaundice, dark urine, and vomiting. Bleeding may occur from mucous membranes and in the gastrointestinal tract. 2. Lab testsLaboratory confirmation is important after the physical evaluation is done by the doctor. Antigen detection: Rapid detection methods include the detection of yellow fever antigen using a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay in serum specimens.It is accomplished by testing serum to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction: This improved technique not only ensures the specific detection of a wide range of yellow fever virus genotypes but also may increase the sensitivity of detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): This is a common test that is able to detect different types of antibodies produced at different stages of the infection. This test uses the binding of antibodies to antigens to identify and measure certain substances. 3. Other tests Lumbar puncture: In case of altered mentation, a lumbar puncture is performed. A lumbar puncture is sometimes called a cerebrospinal tap a medical procedure that can involve collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Computed tomography (CT) scan: Liver function tests (LFT):If the liver is involved, the coagulation profile may be abnormal.

Most cases of frozen shoulder can be effectively managed with conservative/ non-operative methods, while operative/surgical methods are reserved for severe cases that do not respond to conservative methods. I. Conservative/Non-Operative methods: 1. Oral pain relief medications: Certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed to reduce pain and inflammation. These, together with physiotherapy are the mainstay of treatment for frozen shoulder. Examples include- Ibuprofen, diclofenac, and paracetamol. 2. Corticosteroid Injections: In some cases, corticosteroid injections may be used to reduce inflammation and provide pain relief. However, due to potential negative effects, their usage is restricted. 3. Hydrodistention: This process involves injecting sterile water into the joint capsule can help stretch the tissue and make it easier to move the joint. This is occasionally used in conjunction with a steroid injection. 4. Electrical stimulation: It includes two methods Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS): TENS is a therapy that uses electrical currents to relieve pain and promote muscle relaxation. Ultrasound therapy: Ultrasound can help improve blood flow and promote tissue healing in the affected area. II. Operative/ surgical methodsSurgery is typically considered a last resort and is only recommended if conservative treatments have not resulted in significant improvement. 1. Arthroscopic Capsular Release (ACR) surgery: During this minimally invasive procedure, a surgeon uses an arthroscope to cut through the tight joint capsule, releasing the adhesions and improving shoulder mobility. 2. Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA): In this procedure, the scar tissue and adhesions are broken under anesthesia. It is often performed in conjunction with arthroscopic capsular release. Recovery from surgery may take several weeks, and physical therapy is usually prescribed postoperatively to regain full shoulder function. III. Post-operative rehabilitation Post-operative rehabilitation begins promptly after surgery to prevent stiffness.

Viruses and bacteria can enter your body if you are in close proximity to a patient who has an ongoing respiratory illness. When a patient coughs or sneezes, millions of tiny droplets laden with microorganisms get released into the air. If you inhale such contaminated air, you may also get infected. Inhalation of irritant substances: Inhaling dust particles, smoke, and industrial pollutants such as tiny fibers, asbestos granules, acid fumes, etc. may also cause inflammation in the airways and lead to acute bronchitis. Seasonal changes: For some people, seasonal changes can also increase the risk of acute bronchitis due to allergic reactions. It is seen that during the winter season most people experience an episode of acute bronchitis every year. Causes of chronic bronchitis Air pollution : Living in polluted areas and constantly breathing in polluted air can lead to the development of chronic bronchitis. Industrial exposure: Working in industries that continually expose a person to tiny fibers, dust, smoke, acid fumes, etc., which irritate the lungs may cause chronic bronchitis.

Fainting is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain because of the following reasons or a combination of them: 1. The heart fails to pump the blood. 2. The blood vessels lack enough tone to maintain adequate blood pressure to deliver the blood to the brain. 3. There is not enough blood or fluid in the blood vessels. Some of the most common types of syncope and their causes are discussed below: 1. Vasovagal syncopeIt is the most common type of syncope caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, which causes a drop in blood flow to the brain. The most common triggers for vasovagal syncope include: Prolonged standing Fear of injury Physical or psychological stress Dehydration Bleeding Pain Strain Heat exposure Sight of blood When an individual stands, gravity causes blood to settle in the lower part of the body, leading to syncope. In some cases of physical trauma, the body lowers blood pressure and heart rate to reduce the amount of bleeding, which causes syncope. 2. Situational syncopeSituational syncope occurs when a specific situation act as the trigger for a syncopal episode such as: Urination Defecation Forceful coughing Sneezing Swallowing Post-exercise Dehydration Intense emotional stress Anxiety Fear Pain Hunger Use of alcohol or drugs Breathing in too much oxygen and getting rid of too much carbon dioxide too quickly. 3.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)It is caused by a very fast heart rate (tachycardia) that happens when a person stands after sitting or lying down. Usually when a person stands, the nerves send signals to the blood vessels in the lower body to tighten. The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand. This condition is most common in women, but it can occur in men as well. 7.

Diagnosing the actual cause of syncope is very important to prevent further episodes. The syncope diagnosis includes: A. Medical historyA thorough history can provide valuable information in determining the etiology of a syncopal episode. Information about current medications and pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or psychiatric illness can help pinpoint the cause of syncope. B. Physical examinationPhysical exams should focus on examining the vital signs of the patient through neurologic and cardiac examinations. The doctor will measure your heart rate and blood pressure to help determine if a rhythm disturbance or low blood pressure caused the syncope. You may be asked to sit or stand while the blood pressure is measured to test for orthostatic hypotension. C. InvestigationsTests to effectively diagnose syncope include: 1. Electrocardiogram (ECG): ECG is a widely available and inexpensive method that records the electrical signal from the heart and provides information about the potential and specific causes of syncopes like abnormal heart rhythms and other cardiac problems. 1. Echocardiogram: This test uses ultrasound imaging to view the heart and is used in patients with unexplained syncope and with a positive cardiac history or abnormal ECG. 1. Treadmill test (TMT): Also known as an exercise stress test that studies heart rhythms during exercise. It\\'s usually conducted while you walk or jog on a treadmill. 1. Blood tests: These are routine blood tests like complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia, which can cause or contribute to fainting spells. 1. Tilt table test: This test is done when there are no heart problems associated with syncope. During the test, the patient is asked to lie flat on their back on a table that changes positions, tilting upward at various angles and a technician monitors the heart rhythms and blood pressure to see if changing their posture affects them. 1. Blood volume determination: This test determines if the individual has the right amount of blood in the body, based on their gender, height, and weight. Studies show that measuring blood volume may explain the mechanisms of syncope in individuals with unknown causes of syncope. 1. Rhythm monitoring: Heart rhythm monitoring may be recommended to diagnose rhythm problems that come and go and have not been detected with a routine ECG. These include: 1. Holter monitor: This is a device that monitors your heart rhythm while performing normal daily activities at home for 24 or 48 hours. 1. Event recorder: An event recorder may be recommended to capture rhythm problems associated with a syncopal episode. 1. Implantable loop recorder: This provides a way to monitor rhythms over an extended period of time i.e 18 to 24 months. 1. Electrophysiology study: An electrophysiology study (EPS) may be performed if you have heart disease or if you have rhythm problems. Susceptibility to abnormal rhythms can then be assessed under controlled, safe conditions. 1. Electroencephalogram: It involves the measurement of electrical activity in the brain. It is used to diagnose seizures but may be part of the evaluation of unexplained \"collapse\" events. 1. Hemodynamic testing: This test checks the blood flow and pressure inside the blood vessels when the heart muscle contracts and pumps blood throughout the body. 2. Autonomic reflex testing: A series of tests that monitor blood pressure, blood flow, heart rate, skin temperature, and sweating in response to certain stimuli are done to check if there is nerve damage causing syncope.Did you know?Sometimes, fainting may be due to drops in a hormone called cortisol.

Stress: A constant stressful lifestyle predisposes the body to fatigue and increases wear and tear. The person may become weak and have an increased risk of infections due to a reduced immune response. All this may cause the patient to have body aches. Stress is also known to cause other types of muscular pain, such as tension headaches, stiff and painful shoulders, etc. 2. Heavy exercise: An intense full-body workout session may leave the muscles sore and tired. Sore muscles cause pain. When a large number of muscles are involved, it can cause pain in the whole body. 3. Lack of sleep: Around 6 to 8 hours of sleep is essential for the body. While sleeping, the body regenerates its energy resources and refreshes you. A lack of sleep can hamper the overall health of the body. 4. Dehydration: The human body is made up of about 70% water. When you donΓÇÖt drink enough water or lose more water than you consume (such as diarrhea), your body gets depleted of its stock of water. All these factors can lead you to feel tired and achy. 5. Nutritional deficiencies: If you do not consume a healthy and balanced diet, you are at risk for nutritional deficiencies. A deficiency of essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B complex, iron, and potassium can cause your body to feel weak, tired, and achy. 6. Medications: Certain medications such as statins (lipid-lowering medicine) or a few blood-pressure relieving medications are known to cause body aches.

This allows the food to go downwards. There are several mechanisms involved in GERD which may include: 1. Impaired LES function: In normal conditions, LES opens in response to a meal that facilitates the movement of food. LES prevents the migration of gastric contents back into the esophagus. Individuals with GERD have more LES relaxations that are generally not triggered by food. This keeps the LES open even when it is not needed.

The various medical tests that can aid in the diagnosis of GERD are: 1. Esophageal pH monitoring pH is a measure of the acidity. Generally, the esophagus does not have acid. The presence of acid that is reflected by the low pH of the esophagus indicates GERD. It is the most accurate way of diagnosing GERD. This test is also used to check the progress of the treatment. 2. Esophageal impedance test This method is used to assess the reflux of gastric contents back into the esophagus. This is done by inserting a thin tube into the opening of the stomach through the nose. The acid reflux activity is tracked through a computer attached to the tube. The tube stays in place for 24 hours to detect the changes during eating, drinking, sleeping, and doing other activities. 3. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy This involves an examination of the upper GI system (esophagus, stomach, and duodenum- initial part of the small intestine) using an endoscope. An endoscope is a flexible tube attached to a camera. The tube is passed through the mouth and the images are seen on a screen. 4. Upper GI X-ray During this procedure, a special type of camera sends beams to the upper GI. The images of the esophagus and stomach are recorded on the system. This helps in detecting signs of problems such as ulcers, gastric reflux, hiatal hernia, blockages, or narrowing of the upper GI tract. 5. Biopsy In this, small pieces of tissue are taken from the esophagus through the endoscope. These tissues are examined under the microscope for any abnormality.

The two most commonly used psychotherapies that have been found to be beneficial are: Interpersonal therapy (IPT) - This approach focuses on improving the symptoms of depression and mood disorders. In this, a therapist emphatically engages the patient to work on their communication with others and solve their issues. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)- This psychological therapy helps teach the patient various coping skills to manage difficult situations. It helps the patient to change their thoughts about a particular situation and the behavioral component further helps them to change their reactions to any situation. For mild to moderate postpartum depression psychotherapy is an effective treatment. Psychotherapy can also be used as adjunct therapy with medications for moderate to severe postpartum depression. B. Pharmacological Treatment A combination of therapy and antidepressant drugs is recommended for women with moderate to severe depression. Antidepressant medications include- 1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors- SSRIs are the first choice of drugs, which includes Citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline etc. 2. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)- If SSRIs are not effective, then SNRIs are prescribed. These include desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine etc. 3. Other medications- It may require a combination of medicines such as antidepressants, antipsychotic medicines, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines to control your signs and symptoms. Examples include diazepam, lorazepam, bupropion etc. NOTE: Many women are worried about exposing their children to these medications via breastfeeding.

The TNM staging system is commonly used for this purpose: T stands for Tumor, indicating the extent of tumor invasion into the bladder wall. N stands for Lymph Nodes, reflecting whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and the extent of lymph node involvement. M stands for Metastasis, indicating whether the cancer has spread to distant organs or tissues. Based on these factors, urinary bladder cancer is categorized into four stages:Stage 0: Cancer is limited to the inner layer of the bladder lining or consists of very early, high-grade cancer cells confined to the inner layer.Stage 1: Cancer in the bladder's inner lining but hasnΓÇÖt invaded the muscular bladder wall.Stage 2: Cancer has invaded the bladder wall but is still confined to the bladder.Stage 3: Cancer cells spread through the bladder wall to surrounding tissue or may involve nearby organs or lymph nodes.Stage 4: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes and other organs like the abdominal wall, pelvic area, lymph nodes beyond the pelvis, or other organs such as bones, lungs, or liver. Empower yourself with the right information. A second opinion can provide clarity and confidence in your cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. Learn the key things to consider before seeking one. Read This Now Here are some of the common diagnostic measures used: 1. Medical history and physical examinationA doctor will review your medical history, including any risk factors such as smoking, exposure to certain chemicals, or a family history of bladder cancer. They will also perform a physical examination to check for any signs or symptoms of bladder cancer. 2.Urinalysis-2374?utmsource=diseasepage&utmmedium=Urinary%20bladder%20cancerdiagnosis5ctalink0)This involves analyzing a urine sample to check for blood in the urine (hematuria), which can be a sign of bladder cancer. Urinalysis may also detect other abnormalities such as infection or urinary stones. 3. CystoscopyThis is a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube with a camera (cystoscope) is inserted into the bladder through the urethra. This allows the doctor to visually examine the inside of the bladder for any abnormal growths or signs of cancer. 4. Biopsy/Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)If abnormal tissue is detected during a cystoscopy, the doctor will perform a biopsy. It involves removing a small tissue sample for microscopic examination. This procedure, known as transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT), is a surgical method used to assess and treat bladder abnormalities. 5. Urine tumor marker testAnalyzes urine samples in the lab to detect substances produced by bladder cancer cells, aiding in the diagnosis of certain types of bladder cancer. 6. Imaging testsVarious imaging tests may be used to evaluate the bladder and surrounding structures, including: Ultrasound: An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. It can help find out if the kidneys or ureters are blocked. Computed tomography (CT) scan: Uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the body, including the bladder, helping to determine the extent of cancer spread. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed pictures of the bladder. Chest X-ray: Examines the organs and bones within the chest to check for signs of cancer spread. Bone scan: Involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream to identify potential metastasis of bladder cancer to the bones.Booking your tests has never been easier.

Tumor-related complications Weight loss: As a tumor grows, it can put extra strain on the body, making it burn more energy while also reducing appetite. This can lead to unintended weight loss. Fatigue: Chronic inflammation and metabolic changes from tumor growth can cause severe fatigue in people with bladder cancer. Urinary tract infections (UTIs): Tumors can disrupt normal bladder function, leading to incomplete emptying increasing the risk of recurrent UTIs. Spread (metastasis): Bladder cancer can spread to nearby tissues and organs, such as the pelvic wall, prostate (in men), or uterus (in women). It can also metastasize to distant organs like the liver, lungs, or bones. Ureteral obstruction: Ureters, are the two tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Bladder tumors can block urine flow, causing retention, difficulty urinating, and potential kidney damage. Pelvic pain: Bladder cancer can cause pain in the pelvic region, lower back, or abdomen, especially if the tumor has invaded nearby tissues or organs. Anemia: Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a common symptom of bladder cancer. It can lead to anemia (low red blood cell count) if significant blood loss occurs over time. II. Adverse effects of surgery Urinary leak: Urine leakage from surgical sites can occur, necessitating prompt intervention to prevent complications. Pouch stones: Urinary diversions, like continent pouches, can sometimes lead to stone formation inside the pouch, which may block urine flow or cause infections. Erectile dysfunction: In males, surgical procedures such as radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder) can damage nerves and blood vessels involved in achieving and maintaining an erection.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Constipation', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content='Some of the common cases of constipation include: 1. Poor dietary habitsOne of the common causes of constipation is poor dietary habits that can affect bowel movements. If your diet fails to include foods rich in fibre such as fruits and vegetables in the right quantity, it can affect digestion and passing of stools. This is because fibre acts as a natural laxative, which holds water in the stool, increases its bulk and makes it easy to pass. 2. Insufficient fluid intakeLack of sufficient water in the body can lead to dehydration is another factor that can cause constipation. When you suffer from dehydration, the body tries to conserve water by removing water from the stools. As a result, the stools contain less amount of water, which makes it harder to pass them from rectum. 3. Use of certain medicinesConstipation can be caused as a side-effect of certain medicines such as iron salts, opioids, sedatives, over the counter antacids and some of the drugs used to lower blood pressure. So if you are taking any of these medicines, then do consult your doctor. He may either change the dosage of the medicines or help you treat constipation with medicines or laxatives. The list of certain medicines that can cause constipation include: Paracetamol - if more than seven tablets are taken in a week Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen Iron and calcium supplements Aluminum-containing antacids Anticholinergic agents or medicines that oppose the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These include drugs for ParkinsonΓÇÖs disease, depression, delusions, hallucinations, and muscular spasms. Anticonvulsants (drugs used to treat seizures) such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Cancer drugs such as vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, and vinorelbine Calcium-channel blockers such as verapamil Water pills (diuretics) such as furosemide 4. Underlying medical conditionsConstipation can be caused by various health conditions like the following: Irritable bowel syndrome Endocrine disorders like Diabetes, Hypothyroidism, Hyperparathyroidism, Hypercalcemia, Hypokalemia, insufficient production of pituitary hormones Tumor of the adrenal gland Delayed emptying of the colon caused by pelvic floor disorders and colon surgery Diverticular disease Bowel obstruction Narrowing of colon or bowel stricture Colorectal cancer Other abdominal cancer that presses on the colon Rectal cancer Lazy bowel syndrome in which there is slow movement of waste through the digestive tract Neurogenic disorders like spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, ParkinsonΓÇÖs disease, brain injury etc. Structural defects in the digestive tract like fistula, imperforate anus, malrotation etc.Diseases like amyloidosis, lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma 5. Overuse of laxativesLaxatives are common medicines used to treat constipation. In most cases, people with this condition do not consult a doctor but use laxatives to get rid of constipation. However, it is reported that overuse of laxatives is not good for your health. People who use laxatives frequently tend to lose the ability to pass stools without such aids. Hence, in the long run, it can lead to more use of laxatives and an increased risk of constipation.

Abdominal examination in which the abdomen may be examined for distension. The enlarged or swollen bowel may point towards constipation. 2. Rectal examination may be done to look for scars, hemorrhoids, fistulas or fissures around the perineum, the area between anus and scrotum (in males) or vulva (in females). Laboratory test These tests may be done to look for underlying conditions that cause constipation. These may include: 1. Blood tests to check for hemoglobin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), calcium, and glucose levels to reveal signs of risk factors like anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diabetes etc. 2.Stool Examination to check for any signs of infection, inflammation, and cancer. 3. Radiology tests such as Abdominal X-ray, CT scan or MRI of the colon to assess the length and width of the colon or any lesion that may cause obstruction. 4.Barium enema study is an imaging study that uses x-rays along with an enema (containing barium) to detect abnormalities inside the colon. The contrast solution containing barium is injected into the rectum. Barium enema produces better images as compared to other imaging studies. 5. Defecography is a modification of the barium enema examination. A thick paste of barium is inserted into the rectum of a patient through the anus. This procedure then examines the process of defecation and gives information about anatomical abnormalities of the rectum and pelvic floor muscles during defecation. 6.Magnetic resonance imaging defecography is one of the latest tests for evaluating defecation. It is similar to barium defecography, however, MRI is used instead of X-rays to provide images of the rectum during defecation. 7.

Mild constipation gets better with lifestyle modifications. However, severe constipation may require medications. 1. Lifestyle modificationsConstipation can be easily avoided by making a few changes to our daily habits including diet and lifestyle. These include: Dietary Changes First and foremost, drinking at least 3 litres of water is a must for adults. Water hydrates the body and softens stool and aids its movement from the colon. Include fibre-rich vegetables like carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, varieties of gourd etc. in your diet. Blanch the veggies and sprinkle on some seasoning and spices. Have portions equivalent to 250-300 grams daily. A fruit a day will keep constipation blues away. Besides containing dietary fibre, fruits like orange, apple, papaya, dates, figs etc. are packed with nutrients. Substitute white rice and polished wheat with whole grain products like brown rice and unpolished wheat. Oats also have similar qualities. Eat a cup full of these healthy grains daily to fight constipation. Here is a list of food to avoid during constipation. Read More! Lifestyle Changes Using the toilet at a fixed time every day will trick the bodyΓÇÖs biological clock into creating a routine to defecate effectively. The morning is the best time to get started in this regard. Avoid alcoholic drinks as much as possible. Alcohol dehydrates the body and causes stool to harden. Start exercises like jogging, cycling, running and swimming to boost your metabolic rate and fight constipation. Lessen or eliminate the consumption of oil and sugar-rich food from your diet as these upset digestion, cause constipation and lead to obesity. 2. MedicinesLaxatives are compounds which promote bowel movements and are used to relieve and prevent constipation. Some of these medicines are available over the counter (OTC) and come in the form of capsules, suppositories, enemas, pills, gums, and liquids. Most laxatives are advised to be used only for a short period of time. Use medicines only if recommended by your doctor. Bulking agents such as bran and psyllium are fiber supplements, which are usually recommended for normal constipation.They contain fiber which add bulk to the stools and helps the stools to quickly move through the colon. People on bulking agents should drink ample amounts of water to maintain hydration. Lubricants help in smooth movement of stools through the colon.eg. mineral oil. Stool softeners work by moistening the stools eg. docusate sodium Osmotic laxatives stimulate the absorption of water from the body to make stools softer. These include lactulose, lactitol or polyethylene glycol. Stimulant laxatives help in contracting the muscles in the intestines rhythmically. Examples include castor oil, sodium picosulfate, and bisacodyl. Enemas use a thin tube to inject a liquid or a gas into the rectum to expel its contents. Examples: Phosphate enema, mineral oil retention enema, and soapsuds enema. Suppositories such as those containing glycerin or bisacodyl are placed into the rectum.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Stomach Cancer', 'section': 'Diagnosis'}, page_content=\"To arrive at the diagnosis of any kind of cancer, it is important to understand its staging. The most common way of staging stomach cancer is the TNM staging system, where: 1. T stands for Tumor and how many layers of the stomach wall the tumor has penetrated 2. N stands for Lymph Nodes and how many lymph nodes have cancer spread to. It also looks at where the lymph nodes are affected and how close to the original tumor. 3. M stands for metastasis ie. spread to other parts of the bodyDepending on this the cancer is divided into 4 stages. These are:1. Stage 0: Also known as carcinoma in situ. This stage is distinguished by abnormal cells in the stomach lining. The cells can become malignant (cancerous) in the future. 2. Stage 1: Cancer hasnΓÇÖt spread beyond the thick muscle in the stomach wall. 3. Stage 2: The cancer has spread to deeper layers of the stomach and may have spread to a number of nearby lymph nodes. 4. Stage 3: The cancerous cells are present in all the layers of the stomach as well as in some of the adjacent organs like the spleen or colon. 5. Stage 4: Cancer has spread to distant organs in the body like the liver, lungs, brain etc. This is referred to as advanced, metastatic, or secondary cancer. The diagnosis consists of the following: 1. Medical history and physical examinationIt entails examining the body to check general signs of health, including looking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that appears unusual. A history of the patient's health habits, as well as previous illnesses and treatments is taken. 2. Upper endoscopy Also known as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The doctor will insert an endoscope, which is a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a small video camera on the end, down your throat during this test. This allows the doctor to examine the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine. 3.UltrasoundAn ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. There are 2 types of ultrasound devices: Transabdominal ultrasound: It is the ultrasound to see inside the abdomen and check for abnormalities. Endoscopic ultrasound EUS: It is an ultrasound done with the help of an endoscope. This is to help find out the size of the cancer and whether it has spread. It can be used to help remove very early-stage cancers without the need for more extensive surgery. 4. BiopsyA biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. It can make a definite diagnosis for most cancers. 5. Imaging Tests X-Ray: A barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. It can reveal abnormalities in the shape, position, narrowing, or obstruction of the stomach that may be indicative of stomach cancer. Chest X-ray: This can also be done to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs. Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan: CT scans involve taking pictures of the stomach at specific times after the intravenous (IV) injection of contrast medium. It can help diagnose the position of a tumor about nearby organs and blood ves Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the body and to measure the tumorΓÇÖs size. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or PET-CT scan-3740?utmsource=diseasepage&utmmedium=Stomach%20cancerdiagnosis5ctalink3): A PET scan is usually combined with a CT scan or MRI scan to detect and visualize abnormal metabolic activity. 6. Other tests Laparoscopy: A laparoscopy is a minor procedure in which a laparoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a small video camera on the end) is inserted through a small cut in the belly. It is used by doctors to determine whether stomach cancer has spread. Electrocardiogram(ECG): It may be performed if surgery is planned or if you are taking medicines that can affect the heart. HER2 testing: The cancer cells may be tested after biopsy to see if they have too much of a growth-promoting protein called HER2. Cancers with increased levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive.

Many things in our genes, our lifestyle, and the environment around us may increase or decrease our risk of getting cancer. Some of the ways to prevent stomach cancer include: 1. Diet and nutrition Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins Reduce consumption of heavily salted, pickled, and smoked foods. Reduce intake of processed meats. 2. Lifestyle choices Quit smoking. Avoid or limit alcohol consumption. Maintain a healthy weight. Engage in regular physical activity, which supports overall health. Minimize exposure to carcinogens in the workplace. Protect your skin from excessive sun exposure to prevent skin cancer, which can sometimes metastasize to the stomach. 3. Infections and medical Interventions Treat and manage Helicobacter pylori infections. Take medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting (chemoprevention). 4. Health Monitoring Maintain routine health check-ups for early detection and management of risk factors. Note: You can prevent certain types of cancer with vaccines.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Stomach Cancer', 'section': 'Treatment'}, page_content=\"Treatment for stomach cancer depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. It includes: 1. SurgerySurgery is a common treatment for all stages of gastric cancer. The following types of surgery may be used: Endoscopic resection: In an endoscopic resection, surgical tools can be passed through the endoscope to remove the tumor and part of the normal stomach wall around it. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD): These are minimally invasive procedures where abnormal tissues or early-stage tumors are removed from the stomach lining using an endoscope. Subtotal gastrectomy: I n this procedure, only a portion of the stomach is removed, sometimes in conjunction with a portion of the food pipe (in a proximal gastrectomy) or the first part of the small intestine (in a distal gastrectomy). The remaining stomach section is then reattached. Total gastrectomy: This surgery is performed if the cancer has spread throughout the stomach. The entire stomach, as well as nearby lymph nodes, as well as parts of the esophagus, intestines, pancreas, and other nearby organs, are removed. 2. Palliative surgery for unresectable cancerFor people with unresectable stomach cancer, surgery can often still be used to help control cancer or to help prevent or relieve symptoms or complications. Gastric bypass (gastrojejunostomy): This is accomplished by connecting a section of the small intestine (the jejunum) to the upper part of the stomach, allowing food to exit the stomach via the new connection. Stent placement: Using an endoscope to place a stent (a hollow metal tube) in the opening aids in keeping the passage open and allows food to pass through. Feeding tube placement: Some people with stomach cancer are unable to eat or drink enough to obtain adequate nutrition. A feeding tube can be inserted through the skin of the abdomen and into the distal part of the stomach or the small intestine via a minor operation. 3. ChemotherapyChemotherapy employs anti-cancer drugs that may help shrink the cancer or slow its growth, relieving symptoms and extending lives. Also, chemo can help the radiation work better which is known as chemoradiation. Adjuvant treatment: In this treatment, chemo is given before surgery for stomach cancer. It often shrinks the tumor and possibly makes surgery easier. It may also help patients live longer lives by preventing cancer from returning. Neoadjuvant treatment: It is administered after surgery to remove the cancer. The goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill any remaining cancer cells that are too small to see. This can help prevent the cancer from returning. The most often used drugs for stomach cancer are: Carboplatin Cisplatin Capecitabine Docetaxel Fluorouracil Irinotecan Oxaliplatin Paclitaxel 4. RadiotherapyRadiation therapy resembles an X-ray procedure, but the radiation used is more potent, and it can be applied in various ways to aid in the treatment of stomach cancer. Before surgery: For some earlier-stage cancers, radiation can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy (chemo) before surgery to shrink cancer and make it easier to remove. After surgery: Radiation therapy can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy to try to kill any cancer cells that were not removed during surgery. For cancers that can't be removed by surgery: Radiation therapy may be used to help slow the growth of cancer and alleviate symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or eating difficulties. 5. Targeted drugs and immunotherapy These drugs in stomach cancer treatment focus on specific traits of cancer cells to hinder their growth and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.

Stool-based tests Fecal immunochemical test (FIT): This test detects the hidden blood in the stool, an early sign of colon cancer. Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT): This test detects hidden blood in stool using a chemical reaction, helping identify potential early signs of colon cancer. FIT-DNA test: Also called the stool DNA test, it checks for hidden blood and DNA changes linked to colon cancer or polyps in the stool. 2. ColonoscopyThis test uses a long, thin, and flexible tube with a camera on its end to check for polyps and cancer in the rectum and colon. Abnormal tissues can also be removed during a colonoscopy. 3. Flexible sigmoidoscopyThis test detects polyps and cancer in the rectum and sigmoid colon using a sigmoidoscope. A sigmoidoscope is a short tube with a camera and a tool attached to it. The tool is used to remove polyps and abnormal tissues. 4. CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy)This test captures images of the entire colon using X-rays. The images are then studied by the doctor using a computer screen. A colonoscopy is usually performed to remove polyps after CT colonography if it confirms the presence of polyps and cancer. 5. BiopsyIn a biopsy, a small amount of tissue is studied under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis. The tissue can be collected either through colonoscopy or surgery. Sometimes, the tissue is taken using a needle biopsy. 6. Biomarker testingThis test is used to detect certain genes, proteins, and other factors that are highly specific to the tumor. The test is performed on a tumor sample taken from a biopsy. 7. Blood test Complete blood count-1717?utmsource=diseasepage&utmmedium=Colon%20cancerdiagnosis5ctalink0): This test indicates the status of red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood.

Physical examinationThis involves a complete body check-up. The function of respiratory muscles is examined as polio affects the spinal cord and the brain stem, which may infect the respiratory muscles. The muscle reflexes are also evaluated as there may be stiff neck and back muscles or difficulty lifting the head or legs while lying flat on the back. Laboratory diagnosisThe following tests help in the diagnosis and confirmation of polio infection: Virus isolation and detectionVirus isolation in culture is the most reliable method for diagnosing poliovirus infection. Poliovirus is usually isolated from stool specimens or throat swabs. Two samples are collected at least 24 hours apart from patients with suspected poliomyelitis to increase the chances of isolating poliovirus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysisThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can also be used for diagnostic testing of the virus. CSF is collected using a lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap), in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect CSF. Blood testsBlood is tested for antibodies for poliovirus, produced by the body in defense against an invading virus or bacteria. Electromyogram (EMG)EMG measures electrical activity in response to a nerve's muscle stimulation. This test is used to help detect any neuromuscular abnormalities and differential diagnosis of muscle weakness in post-polio syndrome. Fingerprinting the polio virusPoliovirus is isolated and tested by a particular test called oligonucleotide mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing. This test helps look at the virus's genetic sequence to screen if the virus's origin is wild-type or vaccine-like.

Experiencing hormonal changes during menstruation or pregnancy Too much or too little thyroid hormones. Taking diet pills Fever Low level of oxygen in the blood Blood loss Low blood sugar Sometimes, palpitations can be caused because of an abnormal heartbeat that can be caused due to the following medical conditions: Abnormal heart valveConditions such as a mitral valve prolapse affects the flaps or leaflets of the heart that play important roles in the pumping of blood through the heart. The mitral valve is present between the left heart chambers and normally bulges into the hearts upper left chamber when the heart contracts. A defect or a disease that affects the mitral valve can result in an abnormal heartbeat. Heart arrhythmiaPalpitations can be caused by certain conditions that can cause arrhythmia (problem with the rhythm of the heart). Some common heart arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, a condition in which the heart beats irregularly and at a faster pace than normal. Atrial flutter causes a fast and irregular heartbeat and Supraventricular tachycardia results in an abnormally fast heart rate. Abnormal level of potassiumPotassium is a key nutrient that plays an important role in influencing the heart rate. If a person has low levels of potassium they can experience an irregular heartbeat that is known as heart arrhythmia. Excessive levels of potassium can also lead to irregular heartbeat and a person may experience a fluttering sensation in the chest. This results in palpitations and can indicate a serious heart condition that would need professional medical advice. Heart diseasesHeart conditions such as congenital heart defects (heart problems that develop when a foetus is growing), coronary heart disease (a condition that causes plaque buildup in the arteries responsible for moving oxygenated blood through the body) and cardiomyopathy (a condition that causes the muscle of the heart to grow thick or weak) can cause palpitations. Congestive heart failureCongestive heart failure or CHF affects the pumping ability of the heart and is often referred to as heart failure. This condition results in a stage where the fluids within the heart build up and results in inefficient pumping of blood. This condition can result in palpitations and irregular heartbeat. Other medical conditionsSleep apnea: A condition that is caused by the continuous repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep. It is one of the most common breathing-related disorders. Anemia: A condition that occurs due to decreased number of healthy red blood cells in the body resulting in an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body.

If your healthcare provider suspects a medical condition behind your palpitations they will recommend further tests to determine the cause behind the same. Electrocardiogram or EKGThis diagnostic procedure is a test that is quick and painless in nature. It measures the electrical activity of the heart by using sticky patches also known as electrodes. The electrodes are placed on the patient's chest, arms and legs while the wires connect the electrodes to a monitor that displays the results. An electrocardiogram helps in determining whether a person has a rapid or slow heartbeat. Holter monitoringThis is a portable and easy to use ECG device that can be worn by the patient for a day or more. The device records the heart rhythm and rate while carrying out their daily activities. It helps in determining heart palpitations that aren't found during an EKG exam. Smartwatches often contain remote EKG monitoring and can be advised by a doctor. Event recordingThere might be cases when an irregular heartbeat isn't recorded while wearing a Holter monitor and the event may occur fewer times than in a week. In such cases, your doctor may recommend you to follow event recording. This requires a patient to press a button when they experience the symptoms and is usually recommended to be worn for 30 days or more until you experience heart palpitations. Implantable loop recorderAn implantable loop recorder is a device that is placed subcutaneously and continuously monitors for cardiac arrhythmias. These are most often used in those with unexplained syncope and can be used for longer periods of time than the continuous loop event recorders. An implantable loop recorder is a device that is placed subcutaneously and continuously monitors for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias. These are most often used in those with unexplained syncope and are used for longer periods of time than the continuous loop event recorders. Electrophysiology testing enables a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanism of the cardiac arrhythmia as well as the site of origin. Echocardiogram This noninvasive modality uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart in motion. The test helps in showcasing the blood flow and structural problems on the heart and helps a provider in pinpointing the cause behind a heart symptom. Blood testsYour healthcare provider may recommend blood tests to check your hormone levels because palpitations can be caused due to an increase in the levels of hormone seen in cases of pregnancy or menstruation. The blood tests will also help in determining the levels of certain electrolytes in the blood that influence heartbeat such as potassium & calcium. Complete blood count can assess anemia and infection. Serum urea, creatinine to assess for renal dysfunction. Other blood tests, particularly tests of thyroid gland function, are also important baseline investigations (an overactive thyroid gland is a potential cause for palpitations; the treatment, in that case, is to treat the thyroid gland over-activity) Urine testA urine test will help in determining the levels of electrolytes, hormones, blood cells and blood sugar levels in the body. Urine metanephrines testing is used to help detect or rule out the presence of a rare tumor called a pheochromocytoma or a paraganglioma that releases excess metanephrines. Stress testA stress test may be recommended by your doctor to determine the cause of your palpitations. This test allows a doctor to study your heart while the heart rate is elevated. This can be done by making the patient walk briskly on a treadmill or while taking a medication that causes an increase in the heart rate. Coronary angiography **This modality helps in checking how blood flows through the heart. It helps in determining whether you have a blockage in the coronary artery that can result in symptoms such as heart palpitations. In this test, a contrast dye is injected into the arteries while the doctor observes the blood flow through the heart on an X-ray screen.\"),\n",

Eat a healthy dietLow blood sugar is a leading risk factor for heart palpitations. Eating nutrient-rich food and replacing simple carbs with complex carbohydrates is a great way of maintaining stable blood sugar levels. You will be asked to swap fruit juices, white bread, and sugary drinks with whole grains and vegetables. If the cause behind your palpitations is a medical condition such as atrial fibrillation, your treatment will be focused on treating the condition. Medications to treat arrhythmiaAntiarrhythmic medications are used to convert an abnormal heartbeat into a normal rhythm. These medications are also used to prevent the occurrence of arrhythmia. Some of the common antiarrhythmic drugs are amiodarone, adenosine, beta blockers, ibutilide, flecainide and calcium channel blockers . Anticoagulant medications such as warfarin or aspirin are used to reduce the risk of blood clot formation. Electrical cardioversionPeople with persistent arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation may require an invasive procedure such as electrical cardioversion. This procedure is performed after administering short-acting anaesthesia. An electrical impulse is delivered through the chest wall that helps in synchronising the heart and stabilising a normal heart rhythm. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)Radiofrequency energy is used in heart tissue or normal parts to destroy abnormal electrical pathways that are contributing to a cardiac arrhythmia. It is used in recurrent atrial flutter (Afl), atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) and some types of ventricular arrhythmia. The energy-emitting probe (electrode) is at the tip of a catheter which is placed into the heart, usually through a vein. This catheter is called the ablator. The practitioner first \"maps\" an area of the heart to locate the abnormal electrical activity (electrophysiology study) before the responsible tissue is eliminated. Ablation is now the standard treatment for SVT and typical atrial flutter and the technique can also be used in AF, either to block the atrioventricular node after implantation of a pacemaker or to block conduction within the left atrium, especially around the pulmonary veins.'),\n",

Contributing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, excessive coffee or tea consumption, certain medications (like antibiotics), and a diet low in roughage.Symptoms often include a hairy or ticklish sensation on the tongue, bad breath, and occasionally an altered sense of taste. Diagnosis is straightforward, based on the tongueΓÇÖs appearance. Treatment involves improving oral hygiene by brushing the tongue, using a scraper, quitting smoking, and addressing any underlying factors. With proper care, BHT typically resolves quickly.\"),\n",

Based on your answers, your doctor might recommend you to get some blood tests along with additional tests done. The tests include: Antibody test: Individuals infected with Q-fever develop specific antibodies against Q fever including immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Measuring the levels of these classes of antibodies can help confirm a diagnosis of Q fever. During the acute phase of Q fever, IgG and IgM antibodies may be detected. In chronic Q fever, IgG or IgA levels may be detected. The most common serological tests for Q fever that detects the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in the blood or other fluids are: Indirect immunofluorescence Complement fixation Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test: A PCR test is a highly sensitive test to detect the presence of C. burnetii infection in biopsy specimen. It can detect infection earlier than the antibody test, but it is less readily available. However, a negative PCR result does not rule out the diagnosis. Complete blood count (CBC): It is done Liver function orkidney function tests: They are done to diagnose any liver or kidney malfunction. Prolonged infection with the bacteria can eventually damage the lungs and heart. The doctor might suggest a few imaging tests to confirm if the infection has caused damage to other organs. Chest X-rays: Q fever can damage the lungs and cause pneumonia in some people. A chest X ray produces images of the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and bones of the chest, spine, and airways. The test confirms the presence of fluid in or around the lungs, which can be indicative of a concern. The chest x-ray can be performed to see if the lungs are healthy and have no obstruction. Echocardiography: An echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves to produce images of the heart called an echocardiogram (ECG). The images show the heart beat and pumping of blood. Your doctor may recommend you to get an ECG done to identify if the heart valves are healthy and confirm the absence of a heart disease. Tests to rule out other causes for symptoms such as tick-borne disease or more common viral or bacterial infections.'),\n",

Here's more about BMI and how to calculate it.!Did you know?Click Here\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Obesity', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content=\"The root cause of obesity is not restricted to a single cause but many different factors. The leading factors that contribute to obesity are lack of exercise, excessive calorie intake, genetics, emotional stress, and sedentary lifestyle. Obesity is also caused by energy imbalance (between energy intake and expenditure). This means that there is more food energy coming in than going out. If this continues, the person will gain weight until they are obese or overweight. Many factors may contribute to obesity such as: 1. Genetic factorsObesity tends to run in families. A child with a single obese parent has a 3-fold risk to become obese while a child with obese parents has a 10-times higher risk of obesity in future. Genes can affect appetite and thus, how much food you consume. They also control how quickly the body burns calories at rest and during exercise. Genes also influence fat regulation and places of body fat accumulation, particularly fat in the abdomen and around the waist. Very rarely, mutations in the following genes can cause obesity: The ob gene: This gene controls the production of leptin, a hormone made by fat cells and placenta. Leptin controls weight by signaling the brain to eat less when body fat stores are very high. A mutation in the ob gene prevents leptin production and results in severe obesity in a very small number of children. The gene for the melanocortin 4 receptor: Melanocortin 4 receptors are located mainly in the brain and play a key role in the regulation of energy. A mutation in this gene may account for obesity in 1 to 4% of children. However, it should be noted that families not only share genes but also environment, and separating the two factors is quite difficult. In other words, you could be genetically predisposed to being overweight, but your genes may not get activated if you have the right environment and lifestyle. 2. AgingObesity can occur at any age, even in children and teenagers. However, obesity becomes more common with age as the amount of muscle tissue decreases as you age. The result is a higher percentage of body fat and a lower basal metabolic rate (because muscle burns more calories). These changes also reduce the need for calories. So, if you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically inactive as you age, you are most likely to gain weight. 3. Physical inactivityA major factor that contributes to obesity is inactivity or lack of physical activity. Technological advances such as elevators, cars, remote controls, and online shopping have reduced the amount of calories burnt. More time is spent doing sedentary activities such as watching television, using the computer, smartphones, and playing video games. Also, many people have desk jobs where they sit for hours without any breaks. This can lead to obesity in some people because their bodies are not burning enough calories when they are sitting at stretch for hours. 4. Unhealthy dietModern day diet has significantly shifted to energy-dense foods, which have a large number of calories in a relatively small amount. Most of these foods contain more processed carbohydrates, and trans fat, and less fiber. Fats, by nature, are energy dense. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, which in turn stimulate the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin promotes the growth of fat tissue and can cause weight gain. More food advertisements promote high-fat, high-sugar, junk foods like biscuits, namkeen , candy, fizzy drinks, soda, and packaged foods than healthier options like whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Advertised products are designed to be cheap, have a long shelf-life and are specifically engineered to be addictive and irresistible. These convenience foods significantly contribute to obesity. 5. Frequency of eatingIt has been observed that people who eat small meals four or five times daily, have lower cholesterol levels and lower weight and/or more stable blood sugar levels than people who eat big two or three large meals daily. Hence, large and fewer meals can predispose you to gain weight. 6. Eating disordersThe following eating disorders are associated with obesity: Binge eating disorder is characterized by binging i.e.; eating large amounts of food during a short amount of time and usually by feeling guilty or out of control. Night-eating syndrome involves not eating enough during the day and consuming a lot of food or calories in the evening. It also involves awakening in the middle of the night to eat. 7. Medical conditionsCertain medical conditions can lead to weight gain and eventually might lead to obesity. These include: Cushing syndrome is caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. It mostly causes fat to accumulate in the face (called moon face), and behind the neck (called a buffalo hump). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) causes obesity in affected women. Levels of testosterone and other male hormones are increased, which causes fat to accumulate in the waist and abdomen. Hypothyroidism makes the body use less of the energy that one eats as food. The extra energy is more likely to be stored in the body as fat leading to obesity. Insulin resistance is a condition which acts as a precursor for developing type 2 diabetes and can also predispose to obesity. Osteoarthritis causes joint pain that may lead to reduced physical activity and thereby cause obesity. Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition, present at birth that causes uncontrolled hunger. 8. Certain drugsMany drugs used to treat certain diseases increase the risk of weight gain. These include: Antidepressants Antiseizure drugs, such as carbamazepine Antihypertensives such as beta-blockers Corticosteroids Some anti-diabetics Oral contraceptives If this issue concerns you, you should discuss your medications with your doctor rather than discontinuing them, as this could have serious side-effects. 9. Pregnancy and menopauseGaining weight during pregnancy is normal and necessary. However, some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may predispose to the development of obesity. Having several children close together may compound the problem. If a pregnant woman is obese or smokes, weight regulation in the child can be disturbed, leading to weight gain during childhood and later. Many women tend to gain weight after menopause. This weight gain may result from reduced activity and hormonal changes may cause fat to be redistributed and accumulated around the waist. 10. Gut microbiotaNormally, the gut bacteria or gut flora help in digestion of food among other functions. However, an altered gut microenvironment such as long term use of antibiotics, may increase the risk of obesity. Changes in the number and types of bacteria in the digestive system may change how the body processes food. 11. Exposure to chemicalsObesogens are chemicals that disrupt normal development and metabolism. Being exposed to obesogens early in life can increase the risk of developing obesity. These include cigarette smoke, bisphenol A, air pollution, flame retardants, phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls. 12. Psychological factorsMany people eat excessively in response to emotions such as boredom, sadness, stress, anxiety or anger. Adverse childhood events or a childhood history of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse are also associated with a higher risk of obesity. 13. Lifestyle factorsSleep deprivation or lack of the right amount of sleep can result in weight gain. Sleeplessness results in hormonal changes that increase appetite and cravings for energy-dense foods. Cessation of smoking usually results in weight gain. When nicotine is stopped, people tend to eat more food, and their metabolic rate decreases, so that fewer calories are burned. As a result, body weight may increase, sometimes leading to obesity. 14. Socioeconomic factorsObesity and socioeconomic issues are also related. Lack of money to buy healthy foods or familiarity with healthy ways of cooking can increase the risk of obesity. So does lack of safe places to walk or exercise.\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Obesity', 'section': 'Diagnosis'}, page_content=\"Obesity is a disease that is diagnosed by a physician who will measure the patient's height, weight, and body mass index. The physician may also do a physical examination, a laboratory test for thyroid function, and other tests to diagnose the cause of obesity. There are different methods for diagnosing obesity. Body mass index (BMI)The most common way to diagnose obesity is body mass index (BMI). It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. If your BMI is greater than 30 kg/m2, you are considered obese. Being overweight or obese increases the chance of various diseases and chronic conditions. The BMI categorizes people as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. Underweight : < 18.5 kg/m2 Normal weight: 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 Overweight: 25-29.9 kg/m2 Obese: 30-34.9 kg/m2 Morbidly obese: 35-39.9 kg/m2 But, BMI is considered as an old way of diagnosing obesity because this doesnΓÇÖt give accurate results for tall people or individuals with a lot of muscle mass. Waist circumferenceThe new way to diagnose obesity is by measuring waist size (waist circumference) instead of BMI. This method is more accurate than BMI because it doesnΓÇÖt rely on height or muscle mass. Waist circumference greater than 40 inches (102 centimeters) in men and 35 inches (89 centimeters) in women is diagnosed as being obese. People with a larger waistline are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. Obesity is not the same as being overweight. If someone has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more they are classified as obese, whereas someone with a BMI of 27-29.9 will be classified as overweight.

In most cases, you will need to go through an examination from your doctor or have blood work done. You may also have to take some steps before going through the testing process so that you are prepared for the results of the test.Some of these tests for obesity are: Fasting lipid tests: These are done to understand the build-up of fats in your body. Liver function tests: This test is done to determine whether the liver is functioning properly and to know that obesity is not caused due to liver disease.

That\\'s why it\\'s so important to be educated on how we can prevent this from happening and lower the rates of obesity. The question of how to prevent obesity is a difficult one in this modern day. Many factors contribute to the onset and progression of obesity. ItΓÇÖs not an easy problem to solve, but there are ways we can prevent or at least lessen it. 1. Dietary changesHealthier food choices Safe and practical long-term weight reduction and maintenance diet needs to include balanced, nutritious foods to avoid vitamin deficiencies and other diseases of malnutrition. Eat the rainbow diet which is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins like fish, chicken breast or vegetable protein like soy. Low-fat or fat-free dairy, which is rich in Vitamin D, should also be included in the diet. Eat ΓÇÿlow energy density\\' foods which contain relatively few calories per unit weight. For example, you can consume a large amount of cucumbers or carrots without taking in many calories. These foods reduce hunger pangs and make you full on less. Eat foods with a low glycemic index to keep insulin spikes in check. Switch to healthy fats such as monounsaturated fats (olive and canola oil) and polyunsaturated fats (deep-sea fish and vegetable oil) Cutting down calories The first step is to review and record how many calories you normally consume. Usually 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men are recommended for every day. Your doctor/dietician/nutritionist can help you in guiding your daily calorie intake. It is also important to educate yourself in reading food labels and estimating calories and serving sizes. Restricting certain foods Avoid or limit sugar intake. Sugar in any form like table sugar, sweets, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, cakes, muffins, sugar sweetened beverages like fizzy drinks, packaged juices, and packaged flavored milk is detrimental for health. Limit ΓÇÿenergy dense foods\\'. These food items generally have a high calorie value in a small amount. They are high in saturated or trans fats and simple sugars. Examples include red meat, deep fried foods, packaged foods, sweets, cookies, cakes, pastries, butter, and high-fat salad dressings. Avoid empty calories which are foods that provide calories but almost no nutrition such as alcohol, soft drinks, soda and many packaged high-calorie snack foods like biscuits and namkeen. Avoid food items containing harmful fats such as saturated and trans fats. Healthier lifestyle habits Eat small, regular meals and limit or carefully choose snacks. Never skip breakfast as it can lead to consuming too many calories later in the day. Be wary of quick fixes. Do not get tempted by crash, fad or popular diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. They might help in the short term, but you\\'re likely to regain the lost weight when you stop the diet. Consistency is the key. To lose weight and keep it off, one must adopt healthier habits that can be maintained for a long term. 2. Increased physical activityExercising can help people lose weight in a healthy way and keep it off. People who do not exercise while dieting are more likely to regain the weight they lose. Compared to those who are inactive, physically active people have stronger muscles and better cardiovascular fitness. They also usually have lower body fat and stronger bones. A few exercise recommendations are as follows: Indulge in 20 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise five to seven days a week, and if possible, daily. These include stationary bicycling, walking briskly, jogging, swimming, biking, tennis, skating, and skiing. Exercise can be phased out over small sessions of 10 minutes. Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid any injury or excessive fatigue. Over time, build up to 30-60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. Daily activitie such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking instead of driving can burn a considerable number of calories. It is never too late to start exercising. Even elderly individuals can improve their strength and balance by exercising regularly. However, it is always wise to consult your healthcare provider for evaluation of any risks associated with exercising. Parents should also get their children involved in low-intensity physical exercise that will last 20 to 30 minutes per day. This might help children to maintain a healthy weight throughout childhood and adulthood. 3. Get enough sleepYou need to make sure that you are getting enough sleep each night because if youΓÇÖre not sleeping enough, it can affect your metabolism and appetite control, which can lead to weight gain or obesity over time. 4. Reduce screen timeAdults and children spend over 7 hours a day on screen time. This includes sitting or laying down with a smartphone, tablet, watching TV, playing video games and even doing office work on the laptops. Too much screen time is a strong obesity risk factor. It\\'s associated with low physical activity and poor sleep which predisposes to weight gain. Television also exposes one to incessant marketing of unhealthy packaged foods and sugary drinks.

These drugs work by decreasing appetite, increasing the rate at which the person burns calories, or decreasing how much food is absorbed from oneΓÇÖs diet. The following drugs are prescribed for obesity: 1.Orlistat Orlistat works by reducing the absorption of fats from food in the gut. It also reduces appetite and promotes a feeling of fullness leading to weight loss.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Diabetes', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content=\"Diabetes is caused by the body's inability to produce enough insulin or use insulin effectively. The cause mainly depends on the types which include: Type 1 diabetes It is known to be caused due to an autoimmune reaction in which the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas and leads to destruction. As a result, there is very little or no insulin production, which affects the blood glucose control. Even though it can develop at any age, it occurs most commonly in children and young people. Type 2 diabetes It is caused by the body's inability to respond properly to insulin, leading to insulin resistance. This causes the hormone insulin to be ineffective, which in turn, causes the body to produce more insulin. As a result, the pancreas fails to keep up the bodyΓÇÖs demand for more insulin. This gradually causes inadequate production of insulin leading to high blood glucose. Other Types Of Diabetes Apart from Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes, there are other forms you should be aware of. These include: Prediabetes: It is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes can be your bodyΓÇÖs call to act and make some lifestyle changes. Know more about what you can do to stop the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Read This Now Gestational diabetes: It is defined as diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy that affects a significant proportion of pregnant women worldwide. Women usually develop gestational diabetes between the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Monogenic diabetes: As the name implies, monogenic diabetes results from a single gene rather than the contributions of multiple genes and environmental factors as seen in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is much less common and often misdiagnosed as either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. These monogenic forms present a broad spectrum from neonatal diabetes mellitus (or ΓÇÿmonogenic diabetes of infancyΓÇÖ), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and rare diabetes-associated syndromic diseases.

People with these diseases or those who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery are more prone to zinc deficiency. Certain diseasesSome diseases may decrease the zinc absorption and increase the loss of zinc, making the patient vulnerable to zinc deficiency. These include sickle cell anemia, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, chronic diarrhea, HIV infection, diabetes, malabsorption syndrome and cancer. VegetariansThe absorption of zinc from vegetarian diets is less than non-vegetarian diets. Also, the food consumed by vegetarians mostly contains phytates that inhibit the absorption of zinc. Due to this, vegetarians are at a higher risk of developing zinc deficiency. Pregnant and breastfeeding womenZinc is required for fetal growth and development. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are at high risk of zinc deficiency due to high fetal demand during this phase. AlcoholicsAbout 30-50% of people who consume alcohol suffer from zinc deficiency as alcohol decreases the absorption of zinc and increases its excretion in urine. MalnutritionZinc is a micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by the body. It has to be taken from outside sources. People living in developing or underdeveloped countries have a limited access to thsese food which increase the risk of zinc deficiency. Consuming excessive fiberAn adequate amount of fiber in the diet is very essential for a healthy digestive system. But, excessive consumption of fiber can also hamper the absorption of essential nutrients such as zinc. Old ageThe elderly people especially above 75 years of age are at a higher risk of having zinc deficiency. This is because of slow metabolism, poor appetite, and less diversification in the diet. StressProlonged stress is also found to reduce the levels of zinc in the body. Exclusively breastfed older infantsBreast milk provides 2 mg/day of zinc which is sufficient only for initial 4-6 months. The dietary requirement for zinc for the older infants aged 7-12 months increases. At this age, if the infant is only having breast milk they can suffer from zinc deficiency.

Zinc deficient people can have normal zinc levels in the blood. The level also varies as per circadian rhythm, drugs and meals taken. It is usually high in the morning and low in the evening. The normal range is 0.60-1.20 mcg/mL for children and 0.66-1.10 mcg/mL for adults. In the presence of zinc deficiency, the absorption of copper is increased. Alongwith the serum level of zinc, levels of copper and serum copper/zinc ratio is also measured. Serum copper level over 120g/dl and a serum copper/zinc ratio of 1.5 also indicate zinc deficiency. Additionally, several blood tests are also done to rule out other conditions or vitamin deficiencies. These include: Complete blood count (CBC) Serum electrolytes Oral zinc tolerance test: In this test, the levels of zinc are measured after administering zinc. This test helps to detect zinc deficiency caused due to decreased absorption of zinc in the body. Zinc dependent enzymes: The activities of various zinc-dependent enzymes are also measured to assess zinc deficiency. Alkaline phosphatase, carboxypeptidase, and thymidine kinase are three such enzymes. A quantitative measurement of these enzymes also gives an idea of zinc deficiency. Urine testsThe excretion of zinc in urine is decreased as a result of zinc deficiency. The determination of zinc in a 24-hr urine sample also helps in diagnosing zinc deficiency.

Zinc supplements are available in the form of: Zinc sulfate Zinc acetate Zinc aspartate Zinc orotate Zinc gluconate Parenteral zinc supplementation is recommended in rare cases such as intestinal failure or if the patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Interactions of zinc supplementation with medicationsZinc supplements can interact with several types of medications. Patients on zinc supplementation should discuss the intake of these medications with their health-care provider for dose adjustment. Antibiotics: Antibiotics such as quinolone & tetracycline antibiotics inhibit the absorption of zinc.

It usually starts in moles, but most moles aren't cancerous. Normally, old skin cells are shed, but DNA damage can cause cells to multiply abnormally, forming cancerous clusters. The cancerous moles can be a result of DNA mutations. DNA mutations can cause different types of cancers. The gene mutations resulting in melanoma can be of two types: 1. Acquired gene mutations Melanoma is typically caused by gene mutations acquired during life, not inherited. These mutations can happen randomly or be triggered by external factors like UV exposure. UV rays from the sun or tanning beds damage skin cells and can lead to melanoma over time. Melanoma is more common in adults due to long-term UV exposure, but can also occur in areas not exposed to the sun, often due to genetic changes. 2.

Biopsy Shave (tangential) biopsy: A shave biopsy is useful in diagnosing many types of skin diseases and in sampling moles when the risk of melanoma is very low. Punch biopsy: The doctor rotates the punch biopsy tool on the skin until it cuts through all the layers of the skin. The sample is removed and the edges of the biopsy site are often stitched together. Excisional biopsy: This is done to examine a tumor that might have grown into deeper layers of the skin. Incisional biopsy: An incisional biopsy removes only a portion of the tumor. 3. Biopsies of melanoma that may have metastasized (spread) Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)*: It may be used to biopsy large lymph nodes near a melanoma to find out if the melanoma has spread to them. Surgical (excisional) lymph node biopsy: This procedure can be used to remove an enlarged lymph node through a small incision (cut) in the skin. Sentinel lymph node biopsy: If melanoma has been diagnosed and has any concerning features (such as being at least a certain thickness), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is often done to see if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. 4. Imaging tests Chest x-ray: This test might be done to help determine if melanoma has spread to the lungs. Ultrasound: It uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body on a computer screen. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy: It helps assess melanoma by creating detailed images of nearby lymph nodes or tissues to check for cancer spread. Computed tomography (CT) scan: It helps detect melanoma spread to internal organs or lymph nodes with detailed cross-sectional images.

Make food safer to eat Peel the skin and remove the seeds of the fruits. Grate hard fruits and vegetables such as raw carrots and apples or cook to soften and cut into smaller pieces. In the case of meat, serve tender, moist meat that is cut into smaller pieces. Remove all bones from the meat before serving. Give them finely chopped or crushed nuts and seeds until they are four years old. 3. Watch the child while eating and drinking Seat your child comfortably in a chair while eating and drinking Do not let the child eat while walking, running, lying down, or while in a moving car as this reduces the risk of choking Keep the mealtime calm with minimal distractions and encourage the child to chew properly Avoid giving the baby a milk bottle in bed. As soon as the babies fall asleep with a bottle in their mouth, this can draw liquid into their lungs and choking can occur. 4. Avoidance of non-food choking hazards Toddlers and young children explore the world by putting anything and everything in their mouths. Keep the children out of reach of a few things to create a safer environment. Keep small and round-shaped objects out of reach of children including buttons, bottle caps, coins, jewelry, small magnets, and marbles Check for broken pieces of toys or games around the space where the child is playing. Follow age recommendations on toy packages Teach children not to put small objects in their mouths during their playtime Encourage kids not to put pencils, crayons, or erasers in their mouths when coloring or drawing. Make your home a ΓÇ£Childproof homeΓÇ¥ by getting down on your hands and knees in every room of your home for a kid's-eye view. Remove or lock away items that could be dangerous.Did you know?Latex balloons can be a choking hazard for toddlers and young children. If a child chews on a deflated balloon and then suddenly breathes in, a broken latex balloon can fill up a childΓÇÖs airway and form an airtight seal. This can make rescue efforts very hard. Choose mylar or foil balloons instead. !Did you know?\"),\n",

Also, treating the underlying causes is important to stop the episodes of choking. 1. The Heimlich Maneuver In the case of a person coughing forcefully, encourage them to continue coughing to clear the object. Give the person 5 backflows by bending them forward and hitting firmly on their back with the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades to dislodge the object. In the case that a person is not able to cough, speak or breathe, however, needs immediate help. Give them abdominal thrusts, also known as the Heimlich maneuver, to prevent suffocation. Steps of The Heimlich Maneuver Stand behind the person who is choking Place your arms around the waist and bend them forward Clench your fists and place them above the belly of the person Put the other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards Repeat the above steps at least 5 times Learn more about First aid for choking and how you can save a person's life.Click to read more 2. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) CPR is given when the person is unresponsive and is not breathing or only gasping for air. It is a vital and essential skill that can save someoneΓÇÖs life. The two key elements of CPR are pressing on the chest, also called compressions, and providing breaths. CPR on adultsUnless someone is trained in CPR including rescue breaths and feels confident using these skills, then only the person should give chest compressions with rescue breaths.CPR on adults can be classified into two types: Hands-only CPR CPR with rescue breathsHands-only CPR (Chest compression)To carry out hands-only CPR, the steps are: Kneel down next to the person and place the heel of your hand at the center of their chest. Place the palm of the other hand right on the top of the hand placed above the chest to interlock the fingers Position yourself in such a way that your shoulders are directly above your hands Using your own body weight press straight down by 2 to 2.5 inches on their chest Keeping your hands on their chest, and allow their chest to return to its original position Repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times a minute until the help arrives CPR with rescue breathsGiving breaths during CPR can help maintain a supply of oxygen in the lungs. This helps in the circulation of oxygen in the vital organs. The preferred method to give breaths is by using a mask; however, mouth-to-mouth breaths can also be given. To carry out CPR with rescue breaths, the steps are as follows: Place the heel of your hand on the center of the person's chest, then place the other hand palm on top and press down by 5 to 6 cm and give 100-120 compression at a steady rate After every 30 chest compressions, give 2 rescue breaths For giving rescue breaths, tilt the person's head gently and lift the chin up with 2 fingers and pinch the personΓÇÖs nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily into their mouth for about 1 second Continue with this pattern of cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths until the person begins to recover or help arrives Note : For children, it is recommended to carry out CPR with rescue breaths. 3. Intubation A breathing tube is passed into a person's windpipe (trachea). This helps push the object obstructing the airway out of the way enough to provide air to the lungs. If intubation is unsuccessful in a person then the doctor may perform a surgical procedure called cricothyrotomy which involves placing a tube through an incision in the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) to establish an airway for oxygenation and ventilation.\"),\n",

Heart attack (myocardial infarction): It reduces/blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and impacts the heartΓÇÖs ability to pump blood. Cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease): These diseases of the heart muscle may lead to left ventricle dysfunction, damage the heart muscles and change the structure of your heart making it harder for your heart to pump blood. Valvular heart disease (Disease of heart valves): Rheumatic fever may permanently damage the heart valves leading to heart failure. Hypertension (High blood pressure): When the blood pressure is high, your heart has to pump harder than normal to maintain blood circulation. Atrial fibrillation (AF): It refers to the irregular and rapid beating of the heart.

Along with these treatment of heart failure consists of: 1. MedicationsDiuretics: Also known as water pills, these drugs work by removing extra water and certain electrolytes from the body. This increases the amount of urine produced and aids in controlling hypertension and treating heart failure. Examples of drugs that belong to this class include: Furosemide Hydrochlorothiazide Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: They work by dilating or widening blood vessels. This makes the blood flow more freely and the heart can pump blood more efficiently. Examples include: Captopril Ramipril Enalapril Lisinopril Beta-blockers: They slow down the heart rate and make it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. They also lower blood pressure and prevent heart attacks. They also widen the blood vessels in the body for better blood flow. Some of the common drugs include: Propranolol Metoprolol Atenolol Aldosterone antagonists: These work by inhibiting the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that causes retention of sodium and water, leading to increased blood volume, and a subsequent increase in blood pressure. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce fluid around the heart by removing the extra water and electrolytes from the body without loss of potassium. Some of the common examples include: Spironolactone Eplerenone Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs): This class of drugs lowers blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels, improving blood flow, and reducing strain on the heart. Examples include: Telmisartan Losartan Olmesartan 2. Other combination drugs Sacubitril + Valsartan: This combination treats heart failure by relaxing the blood vessels and making it easier for your heart to pump blood throughout your body. In addition, it also helps the body retain less water. Ivabradine: It reduces the heart rate and lowers the workload on the heart and hence the oxygen requirement. As a result, the pumping action of the heart remains fully efficient. Isosorbide Dinitrate + Hydralazine: Isosorbide dinitrate relaxes blood vessels to reduce the heartΓÇÖs oxygen demand, while hydralazine helps maintain its effect. Dapagliflozin: Originally used for diabetes, this drug also helps heart failure by lowering blood sugar, reducing heart risks, and improving survival.

Surgical procedures Angioplasty: It is the procedure for opening up the blocked blood vessels that can restrict the blood supply to the heart muscle ( a major cause of heart failure). Coronary artery bypass: The procedure of coronary bypass redirects a blood supply around a blocked artery. Valve replacement: A defective or diseased valve can be a major cause of heart failure. In valve replacement, a faulty heart valve is replaced by an artificial mechanical valve. Heart transplantation: A heart transplant is needed if the heart muscle function continues to deteriorate despite treatment. People with end-stage heart failure and those with congenital heart disease require heart transplantation. 4. Devices for heart failure Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD): It is a small battery-powered device placed in your chest to detect and stop abnormal heartbeats.

Heart valve damage: It can occur as the heart enlarges and works harder to pump blood due to worsening heart damage. Thromboembolism: An irregular heartbeat can cause blood to pool which might lead to the formation of blood clots. These clots can cause a stroke, peripheral embolism, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Respiratory complications: Pulmonary congestion, respiratory muscle weakness, and pulmonary hypertension (rare) are also seen with heart failure. Kidney failure: Heart failure can reduce kidney function, leading to waste buildup, high blood pressure, and worsening heart failure. Anemia: Kidney damage from heart failure prevents the body from making enough erythropoietin (which helps in the synthesis of new red blood cells) causing anemia.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Vertigo', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content='The ear is the organ responsible for maintaining vestibular equilibrium in the body. The innermost part of the ear, called the inner ear, has 3 loop-shaped structures called ΓÇÿsemicircular canalsΓÇÖ which are responsible for the orientation of the body with respect to movements of the head. Any issue that causes a disturbance in these semicircular canals can lead to vertigo. This type of vertigo which is associated with the inner ear or the vestibular nerve, which connects the inner ear and the brain is called peripheral vertigo.This is the most common type of vertigo. Neurological problems such as brain tumors, stroke, cervical spondylosis, multiple sclerosis, etc., cause central vertigo. The various causes of vertigo are discussed as follows: 1. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) Benign: not dangerous to health Paroxysmal: presents as a sudden, brief episode Positional: set off by particular head or bodily movements Vertigo: an internal sense of irregular or spinning movement either of oneself or of the surroundingsBPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. It is a harmless condition that presents as mild to intense dizziness lasting for a few seconds or minutes. It is often associated with a sudden change in the position of the head or body, like bending over, turning in bed, or sitting up. BPPV usually resolves on its own and is not serious. The inner ear is a system of canals filled with fluid that lets the brain know about movements of the head. In BPPV, small calcium crystals in the inner ear move out of place. Hence, the system is not able to send the correct signals to the brain. BPPV can happen because of a head injury or aging as well. The natural breakdown of cells that happens with age or during injury is thought to be responsible for this. 2. MeniereΓÇÖs diseaseThis is a rare condition that causes severe vertigo, nausea, ringing in the ears, muffled or distorted hearing, hearing loss, and feeling of a plugged ear. This condition is characterized by excess fluid buildup in the inner ear. MeniereΓÇÖs attacks usually happen suddenly and can last from 20 minutes to 24 hours. Patients also feel worn out after the attack passes. 3. Ear infectionsViral and less commonly bacterial infections can cause inflammation of the nerves in the ears. The vestibulocochlear nerve, a nerve in the inner ear, has two branches: The vestibular nerve sends signals to the brain about balance. Its inflammation leads to vestibular neuritis. The cochlear nerve sends signals about hearing. Its inflammation causes labyrinthitis.This inflammation hinders the messages the nerves of the ear take to the brain. Hence, the symptoms of vertigo are experienced. Rarely, another viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus can lead to Herpes zoster oticus, a type of shingles. It is an infection of the inner, middle, and external ear caused by the spread of the virus to the facial nerves. This leads to various symptoms of vertigo. In case it paralyzes the muscles of the face, it is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 4. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma):It is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibular or cochlear nerves leading from the inner ear to the brain. The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause vertigo. 5. Vestibular migraineMigraines are often characterized by painful headaches, however vestibular migraine may or may not involve headaches along with vestibular symptoms such as vertigo and imbalance. People with vestibular migraine do report common migraine symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound etc. 6. CholesteatomaRepeated ear infections, skull or facial bone birth abnormalities or an injury to the eardrum can result in a noncancerous skin growth in the middle ear. This growth is called a cholesteatoma, and as it grows behind the eardrum, it can damage the bony structures of the middle ear. This can lead to the symptoms of vertigo. 7. Perilymphatic fistulaThe middle ear is filled with air whereas the inner ear is filled with fluid called perilymph. Usually, thin membranes separate the inner and middle ear. A tear in these membranes is called a perilymph fistula (PLF) which causes perilymphatic fluid from the inner ear to flow into the middle ear thereby affecting balance and hearing. 8. Central nervous system (CNS) disordersNeurological conditions such as brain tumors, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cervical spondylosis, seizures, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, parkinsonΓÇÖs disease and multiple sclerosis etc., can also cause vertigo. 9.TraumaConcussion and head trauma or any trauma during ear surgery can also cause vertigo. 10. SyphilisLate neurosyphilis may affect the ear leading to hearing loss, fluctuating hearing, or vertigo.Is vertigo a symptom of Covid-19?Vertigo as one of the significant clinical manifestations of COVID-19. It can also be experienced a few weeks after the resolution of the disease symptoms.

History: Before confirming the patient is having vertigo, it is essential to rule out the conditions that may mimic the symptoms of vertigo or any brain disorders. A physician performs a detailed overview checkup, reviewing the patientΓÇÖs history, and can ask the following questions: The characteristics of the dizziness the person is experiencing. Does dizziness leads to imbalance and light-headedness. For how long the dizziness lasts. The frequency of vertigo attacks in a day. The symptoms faced by a person right before a vertigo attack. Balance TestsVestibular system which is located in the inner ear along with the central nervous system is responsible for maintaining body balance. The following tests can be done to evaluate the functioning of these systems: Fukuda-UnterbergerΓÇÖs testThe doctor asks the patient to march on a spot for 30 seconds with their eyes closed. If they rotate or lean to one side, it could indicate a problem in the inner ear, which could cause peripheral vertigo. RombergΓÇÖs testThe doctor asks the patient to stand with their feet together, arms by their sides and then to shut their eyes. If the patient becomes unbalanced, it could point toward a problem with the central nervous system. Rotary chair testThis test records eye movements while the patient is sitting on a rotational computerized chair. The test evaluates the vestibular system which regulates balance, posture and the body's orientation in space. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP)This test is also called test of balance (TOB). It evaluates the ability to remain standing in either stationary or moving conditions. Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) testThis test assesses vestibular function by measuring the reaction of muscles to a repetitive sound stimulus. Video head impulse test(vHIT)The doctor will gently move the patientΓÇÖs head to each side. Eye movements are recorded while the patient focuses on a stationary object like a spot on the wall. Vestibular test batteryA vestibular test battery includes several tests that will assess if vertigo is due to problems in the inner ear or due to some neurological cause. This helps in making an appropriate treatment plan. Electronystagmography (ENG) and videonystagmography (VNG) tests These tests record and measure the eye movements. In ENG, electrodes or small sensors are placed over the skin around the eyes. In VNG, special goggles are placed on the eyes. Patient is asked to look at and follow patterns of light on a screen. Patient is asked to move into different positions while watching the light pattern. Then warm and cool water or air will be put in each ear. This should cause the eyes to move in specific ways. If the eyes don't respond, it indicates damage to the nerves of the inner ear. Imaging testsRadio imaging tests may be performed to determine the cause of vertigo. The following tests can help determine whether the cause is inner ear disturbances or other head and neck conditions like cervical spondylosis, brain tumor, etc. CT Scan (Head) CT Neck MRI Brain MRI Cervical Spine Other specific tests AudiometryIt helps in the diagnosis of M├⌐ni├¿re's disease, a rare disorder of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo.

The staging system used for kidney cancer is based on the TNM system The size and extent of the main tumor (T): Is it confined to the same area or it has grown into nearby areas? The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N) The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): It has spread to nearby organs such as the brain, bones, or lungs. Note: Higher stage numbers indicate more advanced cancer. T, N, and M categories are combined through stage grouping to determine the overall stage, which helps diagnose kidney cancer. Diagnosis consists of: 1. Medical history or physical exam If kidney cancer is suspected, the doctor will review your medical history, ask about symptoms, and check for risk factors. They may conduct a physical exam, check for lumps or swelling, and order blood tests to identify potential kidney issues. 2. Blood tests Urine tests-2232?utmsource=diseasepage&utmmedium=Kidney%20cancerdiagnosis6ctalink0): Urine tests can detect hidden blood or cancer cells, which may indicate kidney or bladder cancer. Complete blood count: This test measures the number of different cells in the blood. This test result is often abnormal in people with kidney cancer. Kidney Function Test: It assesses how well the kidneys are working and help detect abnormalities linked to kidney cancer. 3. Imaging tests Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) scan: A scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of your kidneys. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan: A detailed body scan that can be helpful for investigating confirmed cases of kidney cancer to see if cancer has spread and how well it's responding to treatment. Ultrasound scan: Computed tomography (CT) scan: The CT scan uses X-rays to make detailed cross-sectional images of your body. It can provide precise information about the size, shape, and location of a tumor. Angiography: It is an x-ray test that looks at blood vessels. It can also diagnose renal cancers since the blood vessels usually have a special appearance with this test. Bone scan: This test is helpful to check if cancer has spread to the bones. Cystoscopy: Where a thin tube is passed up your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) so that problems in the bladder can be detected. Chest x-ray: An x-ray may be done after kidney cancer has been diagnosed to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs. 4. Biopsy A biopsy might be done to get a small sample of tissue from an area that may be cancer when the imaging tests are not clear enough to permit surgery. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and needle core biopsy are 2 types of kidney biopsies that may be done.

Acute or short term cough usually lasts less than 3 weeks whereas chronic or persistent cough can last from 3 to 8 weeks. The various causes are discussed below: I. Causes of acute or short-term cough 1. Acute viral or bacterial upper respiratory infectionViral infections of the upper respiratory tract which include the common cold, viral laryngitis and influenza are the most common cause of cough. In such cases, cough is usually accompanied by fever, sore throat and runny nose. Cough can also occur due to bacterial infections in certain cases. 2. Inhalation of irritants or allergensAcute exposure to dust, smoke, toxic fumes, mold, pollen & pet fur can cause inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and initiate coughing. 3. Acute rhinosinusitisIn acute rhinosinusitis, there is an inflammation and infection of the lining of the paranasal sinuses. This infection can cause mucus to collect at the back of the throat, which may make the throat itch. Some people might frequently cough to try to clear their throats, while others might experience uncontrollable coughing. 4. Pertussis or whooping coughPertussis or whooping cough may cause violent coughing led by a gasp for air. Pertussis is caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis that affects the respiratory tract. 5. Lower respiratory tract infectionsThese are more severe viral and bacterial infections which can affect the airways in case of bronchitis and even the lungs in case of pneumonia. They usually cause a deep, persistent cough along with fever. II. Causes of chronic or persistent coughThe reason behind a chronic cough is more difficult to diagnose. It needs diagnosis from a cough specialist or a pulmonologist. Possible causes of chronic cough include: 1. Upper airway cough syndromeUpper airway cough syndrome is a chronic post-nasal drip, which tends to irritate the upper airway, inducing cough. 2. Hay fever or allergic rhinitisAllergic rhinitis is an inflammation of the nasal mucosa, which is secondary to an allergic irritation occurring due to environmental factors. This results in increased mucus secretion. The mucus may also gather in the throat, causing post-nasal drip. This, in turn, may irritate the airways and stimulate a cough. It is usually associated with dry cough, sneezing and runny nose. 3. Chronic sinusitisAfter a bacterial infection, your sinus and nasal mucosa may become irritated and inflamed, resulting in cold-like symptoms and cough over time. 4. Chronic bronchitisExcessive mucus plugging in the airways causes a cough that lasts more than 3 months. Chronic bronchitis is not always of infectious origin but may be caused by bacterial infections in the past. Smoking is also an important risk factor of chronic bronchitis, and thus, a cause of cough. 5. Post-infectious coughWhile recovering from an infection, the cough receptors become hyperresponsive, thereby inducing cough. 6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)In GERD, acidic contents from the stomach enter into the throat. This causes the receptors in the throat to get irritated, causing cough. Cough caused due to GERD worsens on lying down because on lying down the stomach contents travel back to the throat and cause cough. 7. AsthmaIn asthma, the body's immune system becomes hyper-responsive to external factors. This may cause inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity & intermittent airflow obstruction with constriction of the airways, thereby inducing cough. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)It is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs and is usually associated with smoking. A cough caused by smoking is almost chronic in nature with a distinctive sound. ItΓÇÖs often called a smokerΓÇÖs cough. 9. Congestive heart failure (CHF)In CHF, the heartΓÇÖs ability to pump blood reduces. This results in buildup of fluid in the lung, causing cough. 10. Intolerance to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medicineA dry cough is one of the most bothersome side effects of ACE inhibitors taken by people for hypertension. 11. Obstructive sleep apneaIn obstructive sleep apnea, the airways get partially or completely blocked for a short period of time during your sleep. This raises airway resistance, thereby causing chest and diaphragm spasms, resulting in cough. 12. Throat disordersDiseases such as croup in children, cause a distinctive barking cough and a harsh sound called stridor when the child breathes in. 13. Psychosomatic coughThis type of cough has psychological causes such as anxiety, stress and depression and may have been adapted with habit rather than any disease condition. III. Other less common causes of cough 1. A foreign bodyAccidently, food or other objects can go down the windpipe instead of the food pipe causing cough. 2. Tuberculosis (TB)Symptoms of TB are usually coughing for three or more weeks along with coughing up blood or mucus, chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing. 3. Lung cancerCancer starts when cells in the lung begin to grow out of control. It is mostly associated with chronic smokers. 4. Cystic fibrosisThis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and causes chronic cough. 5. BronchiectasisThis is a condition in which airways of the lungs are permanently damaged and widened leading to a buildup of extra mucus. 6. Pulmonary embolismIn pulmonary embolism, a blood clot or embolus travels, usually from the legs, to the lungs causing sudden shortness of breath along with a lingering dry cough. 7. PneumothoraxA pneumothorax or a collapsed lung occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall. It can be spontaneous or due to some chest injury, certain medical procedures, or underlying lung disease. Signs of a collapsed lung include sudden chest pain, dry cough and shortness of breath.Is it cough or COVID-19?COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), commonly causes dry cough among other symptoms such as fever, tiredness, and loss of smell.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia(UHB) or indirect hyperbilirubinemiaBased on the mechanism of bilirubin elevation, the etiology of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be subdivided into the following three categories:1. Increased bilirubin production: This is due to the following causes: Immune-mediated hemolysis - Which includes blood group incompatibilities such as ABO and Rhesus (RH) incompatibility. If the mother's blood has antibodies that do not work with the blood type of a baby, the newborn will experience blood incompatibility and ABO and RH are the two most common types of incompatibilities.Blood group testing is done to determine a person's blood group (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh type.

However, it's still necessary to measure the level of bilirubin to determine the severity of jaundice to decide the course of treatment. Tests to detect jaundice and measure bilirubin levels include: Clinical physical examinationDermal staining of bilirubin may be used as a clinical guide to the level of jaundice. Dermal staining in newborns progresses in a cephalo-caudal (head to toe) direction. The doctor should follow these to do the physical examination of the newborn: The newborn should be examined in good daylight. The doctor should apply pressure on the skin with the fingers to peel the skin and the underlying color of the skin and subcutaneous tissue should be noted. Newborns who are detected with yellow skin beyond the thighs should have an urgent laboratory confirmation for bilirubin levels. Note: Clinical assessment is unreliable if a newborn has been receiving phototherapy and has dark skin. Laboratory testsBilirubin levels can be checked through the following: Biochemical: The gold standard method for bilirubin estimation is the total and conjugated bilirubin assessment based on the van den Bergh reaction. It is a chemical used to measure the levels of bilirubin. Bilimeter: Spectrophotometry is the base of the bilimeter and it assesses total bilirubin in the serum. Spectrophotometry is a method to measure how much a chemical substance absorbs light by measuring the intensity of light as a beam of light passes through a sample solution. Because of the predominant unconjugated form of bilirubin, this method has been found to be a useful method in neonates. Transcutaneous bilirubinometer: This method is non-invasive and uses the bilirubin staining in the skin. The accuracy of the instrument depends on the variation of skin pigmentation and thickness. Clinical approachThe first step in the evaluation of any newborn with jaundice is to differentiate between physiological and pathological jaundice. It consists of checking for the following: Dependency on preterm: Babies who are born before their term needs to be evaluated in a different manner based on the degree of prematurity and birth weight.A baby born before the 37th week of pregnancy is considered to be a preemie or premature baby.

Usually, the condition gets better within 10 to 14 days and will not cause any harm to the baby. The treatments are recommended to reduce the risk of a rare but serious complication of newborn jaundice and kernicterus, which can cause brain damage. If the baby's jaundice does not improve over time, or tests show high levels of bilirubin in their blood, they may be treated with the following: PhototherapyPhototherapy is treatment with a special type of light (not sunlight). It's sometimes used to treat newborn jaundice by making it easier for your baby's liver to break down and remove the bilirubin from your baby's blood. Phototherapy aims to expose your baby's skin to as much light as possible. This procedure consists of: Placing the baby under a light either in a cot or incubator with their eyes covered. A break is given after 30 minutes to feed the baby, change their nappy and cuddle them. Intensified phototherapy may be offered if the baby's jaundice does not improve. This involves increasing the amount of light used or using another source of light, such as a light blanket, at the same time. Treatment cannot be stopped for breaks during intensified phototherapy.During phototherapy, the baby's temperature is regularly monitored to make sure they're not getting too hot, and look for signs of dehydration. Intravenous fluids may be needed if the baby is becoming dehydrated and not able to drink enough. The bilirubin levels will be tested every 4 to 6 hours, in the beginning, to check if the treatment is working and once the bilirubin levels stabilize or start to fall, they will be checked every 6 to 12 hours. Phototherapy will be stopped once the bilirubin levels fall to a safe level, (which usually takes 2 days). It is generally very effective for neonatal jaundice and has few side effects. Note: As long as the level of bilirubin is not very high, the phototherapy treatment can be done at home with a special blanket called aΓÇ£biliΓÇ¥ blanket. Exchange transfusionIf the baby has a very high bilirubin level in their blood or phototherapy has not been effective, they may need a complete blood transfusion, known as an exchange transfusion. During an exchange transfusion, a thin plastic tube will be placed in blood vessels in the umbilical cord, arms, or legs to remove the blood. The blood is replaced with blood from someone with the same blood group. As the new blood will not contain bilirubin, the overall level of bilirubin in the baby's blood will fall quickly. The baby will be closely monitored throughout the transfusion process to treat any problems that may arise, such as bleeding. Post the transfusion the baby's blood will be tested within 2 hours of treatment to check if the process was successful. The procedure may need to be repeated if the level of bilirubin in your baby's blood remains high. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)If the jaundice is caused by RH incompatibility intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used. IVIG is usually only used if phototherapy alone has not worked and the level of bilirubin in the blood is continuing to rise. Kasai operation (hepatic portoenterostomy)Newborns diagnosed with biliary atresia or Type IVb choledochal cyst require a Kasai operation (hepatic portoenterostomy) to allow for bile drainage. This procedure should preferably be done within two months of life for the best outcomes. Other treatmentsTreatment of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia depends on the cause such as: If jaundice is caused by an underlying health problem, such as an infection, this usually needs to be treated. Metabolic causes of cholestasis respond well when there is an improvement in the primary disorder and liver functions. Parenteral nutrition (PN)-induced cholestasis is managed with cyclic PN, reducing the duration of exposure and starting initial feeds as early as possible.

Here are some effective ways by which you can prevent recurrent UTIs: 1 . Drink enough fluidsOne of the easiest and effective ways to prevent UTI is by staying well hydrated. Fluid helps move things through the urinary tract, but it also dilutes the urine so bacteria canΓÇÖt grow. Make sure you drink 1-2 liters of fluids daily. 2 . DonΓÇÖt hold the urineThe longer urine stays in the bladder, the higher are the chances of bacterial overgrowth since stagnant fluid is an ideal environment for an infection to develop. Do not get into the habit of holding on to it for long, since it will make you prone to infection. 3 . Practice good toilet hygieneAfter youΓÇÖre done, make sure you wipe from front to back to keep from pushing bacteria nearer to your urethra. This is especially important after a bowel movement. 4 . Make sure you empty your bladder after sexSexual intercourse can move bacteria from the vagina into the urethra, thereby increasing risk of infection. Urinating after sex flushes out any bacteria that could have migrated to the bladder during intercourse. 5 . Choose contraceptives with cautionIf you are prone to UTI, it is best to avoid spermicides and diaphragms. Spermicides not only introduce bacteria into your vagina but they also alter your vaginal pH, which can create an ideal environment for bacterial overgrowth. Diaphragms may interfere with your ability to empty your bladder completely, thereby increasing the risk of infection. 6 . Use female hygiene products carefullyIf you get UTI too often, avoid bubble baths, bath oils, and perfumed products around genital area. Some doctors suggest switching from tampons to sanitary pads, since tampons may give bacteria more opportunity to enter the body and irritate the urethra. 7 . Change out of workout clothes quicklyIf you are prone to UTI it is best to change out of your workout clothes right after you are done. Excessive sweat can increase the risk of bacterial multiplication which in turn can migrate into your urethra and lead to UTI. 8. Avoid tight-fitting clothesAvoiding tight-fitting clothing can actually help keep you dry, preventing bacteria from growing in the urinary tract.

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Gout', 'section': 'Causes'}, page_content='Gout arises from deposition of urate crystals in joints. Urate crystals are formed due to high levels of uric acid in the body. Uric acid is formed by the breakdown of purine in the body. Purine is a natural substance found in the body. It is also found in certain foods. Usually, uric acid is excreted via the kidneys into the urine. However due to overproduction of uric acid or reduced excretion of uric acid, it can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals. Once the blood is saturated with urate crystals, they are deposited in the bones and joints leading to pain, inflammation and swelling. The main factors affecting serum urate concentration include: Overproduction of uric acidThis condition is known as hyperuricemia, where uric acid level in the blood rises above the normal i.e. 6.8 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). The causes include: Diet: Foods rich in purines such as cooked or processed food from animal and seafood origin is a key element of increasing uric acid precursors. They are: Red meat Fish Alcohol (particularly beer and spirits) Endogenous urate production: Turnover of urate crystals increases in the following conditions: Chronic haemolytic anemia Haemoglobinopathies Secondary polycythaemia Thalassaemia Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Malignancies (cancer) Lead poisoning Drugs: Some drugs are linked with overproduction of uric acid. These include: Diuretics Low dose salicylates Pyrazinamide Ethambutol Cytotoxics Decreased excretion of uric acidMost urate excretion occurs in the kidneys while the rest is excreted through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Reduced renal excretion is seen in the following: Hypertension Hypothyroidism Sickle cell anemia Hyperparathyroidism Chronic renal disease On the basis of causes, gout can be classified into two categories, namely: Primary gout: That is caused due to either overproduction or underexcretion of the uric acid.

Acute gout attacks can last for somewhere between 3 and 10 days, and if you do not get the uric acid treatment in time, it can become chronic, causing permanent damage to your joints. Some of the common symptoms and signs of high uric acid include: 1. Severe joint painGout generally causes severe pain in the joint of the big toe, but the attack can occur in other joints as well, like the knee, ankle, foot, wrist, hand, and elbow or even fingers. This pain is caused due to high uric acid in the joints, which can go out to the space between the bones and end up running against the soft lining of the joints, causing unbearable inflammation. This scenario is referred to as a gout attack. The pain is at peak within the first 4 to 12 hours of the attack and generally occurs either early morning or after midnight. 2. Prolonged discomfortEven after the episode of the gout attack, the joint discomfort can last for days or weeks, but the pain gets subsidized. However, any gout attack in the future on the same joint generally lasts longer, causing sharper pain. Such later gout attacks can also affect other joints which were not affected in the previous strikes. 3. Swelling and rednessThe area affected by gout swells up and becomes red with a feeling of tenderness, making it extremely sensitive to any sort of touch or weight over it. In cases of severe gout attacks, high uric acid can also turn the affected area purple in color. 4. Trouble in movementAs the gout attack becomes more frequent over one joint, high amounts of uric acid crystals get deposited in the joints. This reduces the ease of movement or the comfort of movement, which can also get converted into abnormal movement of the joints. This is one of the common high uric acid symptoms of chronic gout. 5. TophiThe presence of high uric acid can lead to crystallization of the compound in the affected joint, resulting in the formation of small and firm lumps called tophi. These visibly large urate crystals are white and generally form near the toes, knees, elbow, fingers, wrist, or ears. Tophi, which generally occurs in the case of chronic tophaceous gout, can get swollen up to the point of a breakdown or burst and leak a pus-like fluid. The fluid generally does not cause any pain but can prevent the affected person from doing normal activities on a day-to-day basis. In some cases, tophi can also potentially damage the cartilage and bone, leading to extreme pain while using the joint for routine activities. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, another one of the common symptoms of gout in the ankle includes shiny and flushed skin. This is one of the externally visible symptoms, which can help you with goutΓÇÖs early detection.

Family historyIf the history of gout attack runs through the family, then the chances of a person inheriting the genes, which makes it more likely that the kidney would not drain or urate the uric acid out of the body, increase, even if the kidneys are healthy. This happens especially when parents or grandparents have suffered from gout during their lifetime. 2. Gender and ageMen are more prone to developing gout as their body naturally contains a higher level of uric acid, and the risk is at its peak during the age of 30-50 years. Whereas for women, the levels of uric acid generally tend to be lower than that of males. However, after menopause, the concentration of uric acid in a female body reaches almost equivalent to that of a male body and puts them at an equivalent risk of developing gout. 3. Surgery or traumaIf an individual has undergone surgery or a traumatic experience, then the chances of developing gout increase. This is true especially in the case of an organ transplant due to the effects of the anti-rejection drugs prescribed to the patient after such surgical procedures. 4. Race/ethnicityThe risk of development of gout varies across populations according to race and ethnicity. According to studies, African Americans had a twofold increased risk of gout when compared to other people. 5. Genetic factorsGenetic aberrations in genes SLC22A12 SLC22A12 which are integral to uric acid absorption can also predispose to gout. 6. Other chronic diseasesOther ailments like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart diseases, and kidney-related diseases put an individual at a greater risk of being vulnerable to developing gout on top of foot, ankle joint, and other joints. Thus, if you are suffering from any medical condition, it is prudent that you consult a doctor to avoid the risk of developing gout further. Modifiable factors 1. High purine dietFood and beverages with high purine content like red meat, shellfish, or beer increase the risk of high levels of uric acid in the blood and, thus, the risk of developing gout. To reduce uric acid levels in your blood and avoid the risk of gout on top of foot or any other joint, you should ensure that you eat a balanced diet with low purine content. 2.ObesityBeing overweight increases the amount of uric acid produced by the body, which puts a lot of stress on the kidneys to excrete it. This often leads to saturation of uric acid in the blood due to the inability of the kidney to eliminate high levels of uric acid daily. Thus, to avoid the risk of gout, particularly chronic tophaceous gout, you must exercise and maintain an active physical regime to keep your body mass index (BMI) in check and reduce uric acid content in the body. 3. Certain medicationsSome medications used to control hypertension or low dose aspirin or beta-blockers can also cause a higher level of uric acid concentration in the blood and hence increasing the risk of gout. Thus, it is always wise to check the side effects of your medications with your doctor before consuming them so that you can find a solution to reduce uric acid concentration in your body. 4. Alcohol consumptionStudies have reported that alcohol intake increases the risk of developing gout. Alcohol ingestion increases lactate levels which inhibit uric acid excretion via the kidneys. Alcohol also prompts purine degradation, leading to an increased uric acid level. 5. Fructose/sweetened- sugar beveragesIncreased quantities of fructose and sugar-sweetened beverages (main sweetener being fructose) in the diet, contribution to gout.

A diagnosis for gout is usually done in any of the following ways: Physical examinationDepending upon the case, a doctor might be able to confirm the presence of gout via a physical examination of the patient as the effects of a gout attack are visible near and over the affected skin area. During physical examinations, the most commonly and easily found gout is gout on top of foot. Blood test Uric acid: This test checks the concentration of uric acid in the blood, which can hint toward the possibility of the presence of gout as the correlation between uric acid and gout is quite high. A uric acid level in the blood over 6.8 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) is high. However, not everyone with a high uric acid level has gout. Urine test Uric acid: The uric acid urine test can also be used to measure the level of uric acid in urine. A 24-hour urine sample is needed for the same. Imaging tests X-ray of affected joint: The medical condition can also be detected with the help of an x-ray examination of the affected joint. An x-ray enables the doctors to check the presence of uric acid crystals as well as bone damages in the affected area. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is used for detection of joint effusion, synovitis (inflammation of soft tissues lining the joint spaces) and evaluation of cartilage, bone contour, and crystal deposition. Conventional CT (CCT): CT is characterized by excellent resolution and high contrast, hence it is the best technique for the assessment and characterization of urate crystals. Dual-energy CT (DECT): This new imaging technique for diagnosis of gout that allows the differentiation of deposits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI helps in assessment of inflammation, synovial thickening and erosion of joints. Nuclear scintigraphy: It uses very small, tracer amounts of radioactive molecules to diagnose diseases involving bone and soft tissues. Positron emission tomography (PET): This technique is helpful when gout presents at unusual locations. Other tests Synovial fluid analysis: Synovial fluid is a thick, straw-colored liquid found in small amounts in the joints. Its analysis helps to diagnose and treat joint problems like Gout.

Some of the ways in which you can relieve gout knee pain, gout pain in foot, and other joints are: 1. Avoid or limit alcoholAlcohol consumption impacts the ability of the body to excrete uric acid from the system, which as a result increases the concentration of uric acid in the blood and poses a greater threat of developing or undergoing a gout attack. Similarly, fructose-sweetened drinks also cause the same condition, and hence their consumption should be either avoided or limited to reduce the risk of gout. 2. Increase intake of waterIncreasing water consumption aids the kidney in flushing out the uric acid with urine and hence, reducing the chances of developing urate crystals in the body. However, the ideal amount of water consumption varies on an individual basis, depending upon their age, sex, level of fitness, and other factors. 3. Maintain a healthy body weightAn individual with healthy body weight is less vulnerable to a gout attack, as obesity leads to a higher level of uric acid in the body, making the job of kidneys of flushing out the uric acid difficult. However, it is important to note that weight loss should not be sudden as it can cause other complications. You should aim for a gradual and steady weight loss journey that will help reduce the risk of developing gout. 4. Avoid a high purine dietCertain food items naturally contain a higher level of purine, which can lead to a higher level of uric acid in the body. This is because purine is naturally broken down in the body to form uric acid. Food items like red meat, tuna, turkey, bacon, and alcoholic beverages should be either avoided or consumed in a limited quantity to avoid the risk of developing a higher concentration of uric acid in the blood. Foods good for arthritis and gout include nuts, olive oil, berries, dark leafy greens, garlic, and onion. 5. Avoiding certain medicationsMedications like diuretics can cause hyperuricemia - which is a higher level of uric acid concentration in the blood. If someone is consuming such medications, they should consult their doctor to see if there is a replacement or substitute for such drugs.

Stretched and shiny skinIn edema, the skin above the swelling area may appear stretched and glossy. The stretching of the skin is due to excess fluid that pulls the skin. 3. PittingPoor circulation or the retention of extra fluids are the most common causes of pitting edema. A dimple in the skin can be created by gently pressing in on the swelling area with the finger for at least 5 seconds and then removing your finger. 4. Aching body partsThe aching pain can be local or general. It depends upon the underlying cause of edema. Excess fluid and disturbed cellular activities are the cause of pain in edema. 5. Weight gainUnexplained weight gain could be due to fluid retention. Weight gain can make limbs, hands, feet, face, or abdomen appear puffy. 6. Decreased urine outputIf kidney disease is the underlying cause of edema, urine output could get affected. The kidneys are vital organs that help in blood purification. During this process, the excess fluid along with toxins and waste is eliminated in the form of urine. In kidney disorders, the kidney fails to produce urine in adequate quantities and, as a result, edema develops. 7.

Damage to veins in the legsThe one-way valves in the leg veins are weakened or destroyed allowing blood to pool and produce swelling. A blood clot (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT) in one of the leg veins can cause sudden swelling in one leg, as well as pain in the calf muscle. In this condition, one must get medical attention immediately. 5. Inadequate lymphatic systemThe lymphatic system aids in the removal of excess fluid from tissues. If this system gets affected, like in cancer surgery, the lymph nodes and lymph arteries that drain an area may not function properly, resulting in edema. 6. Protein deficiencyAlbumin and other proteins in the blood behave like sponges, allowing fluid to flow freely through your blood vessels. Over time, a deficiency of protein in the diet might result in fluid accumulation and edema. However, it is rarely the cause. 7. Allergic reactionsEdema is a common side effect of allergic responses. Nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area in response to the allergen. 8.

The peritoneum covers the liver, stomach, kidneys, and bowels. This peritoneal covering has two layers, one outer and one inner layer. Accumulation of fluid between these two layers is called ascites. Fluids can get accumulated between these layers when there is a build-up of pressure in the veins present in the liver, and they stop working the way they should. The increased pressure prevents the flow of blood into the liver, and over time kidneys are unable to remove the excessive amount of salt from the body. This causes fluid build-up resulting in ascites. The build-up of pressure is primarily caused by liver cirrhosis, heart failure, kidney failure, cancer or an infection. Liver cirrhosisCirrhosis accounts for 84% cases of ascites. Liver cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease in which the healthy liver tissue is replaced with scarred tissue resulting in permanent damage to the liver. The scar tissue prevents the liver from functioning normally and causes inflammation and cell death of the liver. Cirrhosis can be caused by various diseases such as hepatitis, fat accumulation in the liver, and iron buildup in the body. The leading cause of liver cirrhosis is an excessive amount of alcohol intake. Liver cirrhosis results in an increase in the blood pressure of the portal vein that carries blood from the digestive organs towards the liver. When the pressure rises, there is a decline in the functioning of the kidneys that causes fluids to build up in the abdomen. This results in cirrhotic ascites. Cirrhosis of the liver is a result of long-term liver damage which causes liver scarring. Read more about it. Click Here! CancerRecurrent cancer or late-stage cancer can result in ascites. Primarily cancer can spread to the lining of the peritoneal covering of the organ and cause it to leak. These are called malignant ascites. Secondly, cancer can spread to the liver itself and cause the build-up of pressure within the liver. This prevents the functioning of the kidney and results in ascites. Cancers such as colon cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer are more likely to cause ascites. In peritoneal cancer, the tumor cells present in the lining of the abdomen produce a proteinaceous fluid that causes ascites. Heart failure or kidney failureAscites can occur when there is increased pressure of the hepatic veins and the veins that drain the lining of the organ. This is usually caused by long-standing venous hypertension. A heart failure or kidney failure can result in the decline of the blood volume of the arteries, vessels that carry blood throughout the body. This can further cause changes in the different body systems and cause the blood vessels of the kidneys to constrict, resulting in sodium and water retention leading to ascites. BuddΓÇôChiari syndromeBuddΓÇôChiari syndrome is caused by occlusion of the hepatic veins that drain the liver. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and liver enlargement. Pancreatic ascitesChronic pancreatitis is the most significant risk factor for the development of pancreatic ascites. It occurs when pancreatic secretions collect in the peritoneum as a result of a pancreatic duct injury. It most often follows necrotizing pancreatitis with major pancreatic duct injury or via fistula formation which communicates with the peritoneum. Other rare causes: Meigs syndrome (It is the triad of benign ovarian tumors with ascites and pleural effusion) Vasculitis (swelling and redness of the blood vessels) Hypothyroidism (decreased production of thyroid hormones) Mastocytosis (a condition in which mast cells are formed in excess)'),\n",

              " Document(metadata={'disease': 'Ascites', 'section': 'Diagnosis'}, page_content=\"Diagnosing ascites can take multiple tests that may require you to go through some particular tests. Your doctor will carry out a physical examination where they'll check the swelling in the abdomen and carry out an examination. You can also be asked to take blood tests that will measure the protein levels in your blood. Other imaging and testing methods can include: UltrasoundAbdominal ultrasound is an examination modality that uses sound waves that helps in creating an image of the organs present in the abdomen. For an ultrasound, the patient may be asked to fast for the next eight to 12 hours before the ultrasound. This is done to prevent undigested food from blocking the sound waves and preventing a clear picture. You can also be asked to consume a fat-free meal the evening before your test in case of a liver or pancreas ultrasound. A doctor or health provider uses a handheld probe and moves it over the abdomen to take the ultrasound. This in turn creates a digital image on the screen that can be viewed by the doctor. This imaging modality is painless and images are captured in real-time. It will show the structure and movement of blood through the blood vessels of the abdomen. Abdominal ultrasonography can detect as little as 100 ml of ascitic fluid. CT scanA CT scan is also known as computed tomography. It is a specialized form of X-ray and shows the cross-sectional view of a specific body part. The CT scan circles around the body and sends images to the computer where they can be viewed by a medical professional. An abdominal CT scan can help the doctor view the organ and blood vessels present in the abdominal cavity. CT scan provides multiple images of the body and allows medical professionals to make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor may ask you to fast for two to four hours before the CT scan and stop certain medications. You can also be asked to drink a glass of water or oral contrast that can help in getting a better view of the stomach and bowel. MRI scan Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI is a testing modality that uses magnets and radio waves to create images of the inside of the body. This non-invasive technique uses magnets and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the abdomen that allows healthcare professionals to view any abnormality present inside the tissues and organs of the abdomen. An MRI uses no radiation and is considered to be a safer alternative to a CT scan. You will be asked to lie on your back and given a blanket and pillow while a technician will communicate with you via a microphone. The MRI machine makes loud noises that can be disturbing. The scan requires the patient to be completely still as the machine is sensitive towards movements. LaparoscopyIt is a surgical diagnostic procedure that allows the examination of the organs presents inside the abdomen. This is a low-risk and minimally invasive procedure that is carried out via a small incision. It uses an instrument called a laparoscope that has a high-intensity light and a high-resolution camera at the front. The doctor will insert the instrument through a small incision in the abdomen and move the rod along with the camera that will further send images to the video monitor. Your doctor will be able to view the inside of the body in real-time and also collect tissue samples if needed. It is usually performed when non-invasive methods such as CT scan and MRI scan are unable to help with the diagnosis. Fluid sample (diagnostic paracentesis)Your doctor may take a sample of fluid present inside your abdomen through a needle. The fluid will be sent back to the laboratory, where it will be checked for the signs of disease such as infection or cancer. This test can help in pointing towards the cause of ascites. You will be given local anesthesia before this procedure. The fluid is then reviewed for its gross appearance, protein level, albumin, and cell counts (red and white). Additional tests will be performed if indicated such as microbiological culture, Gram stain (to check for bacteria), and cytopathology (examination of cells and fluids of the body). The serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is probably a better discriminant than older measures (transudate versus exudate) for the causes of ascites. A high gradient (> 1.1 g/dL) indicates the ascites are due to portal hypertension. A low gradient (< 1.1 g/dL) indicates ascites of non-portal hypertensive as a cause. ClassificationAscites exist in three grades: Grade 1: Mild, only visible on ultrasound and CT Grade 2: Detectable with flank bulging and shifting dullnessGrade 3: Directly visible, confirmed with the fluid wave/thrill test\"),\n",

Lifestyle changesSome common lifestyle changes that can help in the treatment of ascites include avoiding alcohol and limiting salt intake in your diet. You should not have more than 1500 mg/day of sodium or as directed by the doctor. You will also be asked to limit the intake of some types of fluids. 2. Water pillsThese are also known as diuretic pills are used to flush out the extra fluid from the body. The most commonly used diuretic pills are furosemide and spironolactone, which help the kidney remove excess sodium and water. These pills are most effective for ascites and reduce the pressure around the liver. Use of spironolactone may be limited by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and painful gynecomastia (tenderness in the breasts). If gynecomastia is distressing, amiloride may be substituted for spironolactone. Furosemide is usually combined with spironolactone in a ratio of 40:100; maximal daily doses of spironolactone and furosemide are 400 mg and 160 mg, respectively. Your doctor may ask you to monitor your blood chemistry while on the medications and reduce your salt and alcohol intake. 3. Pharmacologic therapyIt is used for refractory ascites and includes the addition of midodrine or clonidine, alpha-adrenergic agonists, to diuretic therapy. These agents constrict the vessels counteracting splanchnic dilation of the vessels. 4. Therapeutic paracentesisThis procedure is carried out by medical professionals. They use a long and thin needle to remove the accumulated excessive fluid from around the abdomen. The needle will be inserted through the skin and into the abdominal cavity. After the procedure, you will be asked to maintain a low salt and fluid diet to prevent the fluid from getting recollected. This procedure is usually recommended in patients with severe or recurrent ascites that do not show improvement with diuretics. Patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis should receive i/v albumin infusions of 6-8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed. 5. UltrafiltrationIf the person exhibits a resistance or poor response to diuretic therapy, ultrafiltration or aquapheresis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention and congestion. The use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can be beneficial in people with diuretic resistance and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of diuretics 6. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)Severe cases of ascites may require a permanent tube called a stent (wire mesh) which will be inserted inside the body. This will be inflated inside the body and will form a channel or shunt that will bypass the liver. This will help in rerouting the blood flow from around the liver and hence decrease the need for regular drainage. This may be recommended when the diuretics fail to show any improvement in the patient's symptoms. 7. Liver transplantationIn the case of severe liver disease where the ascites don't improve, the patient may require a liver transplant. Ascites from liver or kidney failure may require surgery. In case the underlying cause of the ascites is a bacterial or viral infection, your doctor will treat you with other therapies to treat the cause and relieve the symptoms. Ascites that are refractory to medical therapy are considered an indication for liver transplantation. In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritise people for transplantation. The MELD Score has been validated as a predictor of survival in patients with cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute liver failure.\"),\n",

It also looks at where the lymph nodes are affected and how close to the original tumor. M: Metastasis ie. spread to other parts of the bodyDepending on this the cancer is divided into 4 stages. These are:1. Stage 0: Also known as carcinoma in situ. This stage is distinguished by abnormal cells in the liver lining. The cells can become cancerous (malignant) in the future. 2. Stage I: Cancer is localized to the liver and has not spread to nearby blood vessels or lymph nodes. 3. Stage II: Cancer has either grown larger and/or has invaded nearby blood vessels but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes. 4. Stage III: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or structures beyond the liver, but it has not spread to distant organs. 5. Stage IV: Cancer has spread to distant organs or structures, indicating advanced metastatic disease.The diagnosis consists of the following: 1. Medical history and physical examinationYour doctor will begin by taking a detailed medical history, including any risk factors for liver cancer, your medications, lifestyle habits, previous surgeries, or any other health conditions. A physical examination may reveal signs such as an enlarged liver and jaundice. 2.

Click Here Causes Of Autism Autism is a complex disorder and thereΓÇÖs no exact cause for it, however, it can develop from a combination of genetic and nongenetic, or environmental influences. These influences appear to increase the risk that a child will develop autism. Risk Factors For Autism The fact that symptoms and severity vary from person to person and the complexity of this disorder, both genetics and environment may play a major role. Genetic risk factors 1. Genetic mutation: Most individuals with autism have rare gene mutations (changes) and these mutations occur in only a single gene. 1. Heritability: The recurrence risk of pervasive developmental disorder in siblings of children with autism is 2% to 8%. Environmental risk factors 1. Paternal age: Studies suggest that advanced paternal age was associated with an increased risk of autism that in turn is associated with gene mutations. These mutations occur with advancing age. 1. Environmental chemicals: Several environmental agents were identified as strong contributors to learning and developmental disabilities in humans. These include: Arsenic Lead Manganese Mercury Pesticides Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) Solvents 1. Drugs: Exposure to pharmacological agents particularly during pregnancy represents a highly relevant environmental concern relative to the risk of autism. These include: Valproic acid (VPA) Thalidomide Misoprostol Beta 2 adrenergic agonist drugs Antipyretics 1. Dietary factors: Diet-influenced factors are part of the potential environmental risk factors for autism that have been largely overlooked until recently. These include deficiencies of the following: Vitamin D: Some studies have found that mothers of autistic children versus those with non-autistic children have reduced serum vitamin D levels. Folic acid: Folate availability has also been suggested as a possible factor in the risk of autism because of its role in affecting neurodevelopment. 1. Infections: The idea that maternal and/or early infant infections could influence neurodevelopment and contribute to adverse outcomes. 1. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART): Children conceived using ART were more likely to be diagnosed with autism than those conceived naturally. 1. Pregnancy-related factors: Studies demonstrate that certain prenatal factors that aid in the development of autism include: Maternal asthma Allergic conditions Maternal toxemia or bleeding Prenatal stressors Beginning of prenatal care Urbanization of birthplace Pregnancy and birth complications like extreme prematurity, low birth weight, multiple pregnancies Pregnancies spaced with less than a one-year gap Understand week-by-week symptoms related to pregnancy. Watch This Diagnosis Of AutismEvaluation of autism begins with a screening of the general pediatric population to identify children at-risk or demonstrating signs suggestive of autism, after which a thorough diagnostic evaluation needs to be done. A parent interview, collection of any outside informant observations, and direct clinician observation of the childΓÇÖs current cognitive, language, and adaptive functioning by a clinician experienced with autism should be components of this comprehensive assessment. Further, diagnostic evaluation include: Complete physical examinationIndividuals with autism often have a number of unusual physical characteristics, which can be evaluated by the following: 1. Assessment for dysmorphic features: Dysmorphology is the study of the atypical development of physical features which include birth defects like presence or absence of ear pit. 1. Full neurologic examination with head circumference: Individuals with autism often show a high level of anxiety and are frequently affected by comorbidities that influence their quality of life. Also, studies demonstrate children with autism often exhibit an atypical trajectory of head circumference (HC) growth, which may be an indicator of vulnerability to autism. 1. WoodΓÇÖs lamp examination of the skin: This test is often used to make a diagnosis of specific skin and hair disorders. Genetic testingCurrently, no clear biomarkers or diagnostic measures exist for autism, and the diagnosis is made based on the fulfillment of descriptive criteria. Given a relatively high yield in patients with autism, clinical genetic testing is recommended. It can provide information regarding medical interventions or work that might be necessary and help with family planning. Note: Children with autism should also be screened for other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include blood tests and hearing tests.
